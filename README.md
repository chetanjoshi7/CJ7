Project Description
------------------


Agile Development
-----------------
We are following a SCRUM model for our software development.

Scrum is a form of Agile development where a product is produced at the end of a "sprint".
Our sprint length is 1 week long.
At the start of a sprint we have a sprint meeting wher we outline all of the sprint tasks we want to complete and any extra tasks that cannot fit within the sprint are placed into a backlog.

We have modified the scrum ceremonies as follows:

* Sprint Planning -- this occurs at the start of a sprint and where the team outlines all user stories/task that need to be completed for that specific sprint
* Daily Scrum -- we will not be having any daily scrum meetings, due to time constraints and commitments outside of this class
* Sprint Review -- at the end of every sprint there is a sprint review meeting where each member of the team summarizes there work and brings forth any concerns or comments they have.
