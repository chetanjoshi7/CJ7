A really brutal, terrifying home, what with all of the monsters and war and whatnot, but home nonetheless.Riordan continues to blow me away with these books and I''m really not sure what I''m going to do when I finish this series. But luckily for me, I have almost a thousand pages before I need to worry about that. However, I digress, let''s move on to the good stuff!This book! Ahhhhhh!!!!! That covers it pretty accurately.The Percabeth reunion! Perfection. It was done in true Percabeth form. "Hi, sweetheart, I''m sorry I went missing for six months after a nutty goddess stole my memory. Give me a kiss and then we''ll go stop the vicious goddess of Earth from rising." I mean, what else did I expect?Coach Hedge. I freaking love Coach Hedge; he''s the perfect non chaperone chaperone to have on the "Argo II."I loved seeing the "Big Seven" together for the first time (even if it wasn''t the great first meeting) and I really enjoyed watching them grow as a team as the book went on.I love each of the "Big Seven" but seriously, how can anyone not love Leo Valdez? The part with Leo and Echo and Narcissus had me laughing out loud. Oh goodness. Such a great moment.The performing giants! Glad to see that the monsters are broadening their horizons a bit. Killing demigods just doesn''t pay the bills, you know.Annabeth is such a boss! I was literally cheering for her when she was on her journey, and she came out victorious! (Kind of, but we''ll get to that in a minute.)Thank you, Rick Riordan, for writing a kick butt female heroine that is smart, strong, and brave. I love that Annabeth was/is kind of the leader of the team; everyone looks to her because of her wisdom and knowledge. The feminist in me did a fist pump for that.Ok, that freaking cliff hanger. What the what?! Rick! How could you do that to my babies? Ugh. I knew it was coming, but it was like my stomach dropped down with them.This book was phenomenal!

Two books to go!SERIES REVIEWIs it really so hard to write a satisfying ending? The Blood of Olympus, the fifth and final book of the Heroes of Olympus series, lost its way--and not even everyone''s favorite demigods could save this book from itself. After four years of build up, everything about The Blood of Olympus felt rushed. The ending, which should have been magnificent, was forced and anticlimactic. Somewhere along the way Nico''s personal problems replaced saving the world as the main conflict the series needed to resolve, and it''s felt from front cover to back cover of The Blood of Olympus. That ending...blah. I was so disappointed.Which is such a bummer, because up until the last book, Heroes of Olympus was so much fun!A watch out from parent to parent: In the 4th book, The House of Hades, the character Nico, who is 14, reveals that he feels same-gender attraction to Percy Jackson. He says he has had a "crush" on Percy for a long time. We learn that the reason he stays distant and keeps to himself is because of his heartache and shame. In the 5th book, Nico continues to struggle with feeling shame and guilt. He finds acceptance in the end, and he discovers he really does have a place to belong after all. He tells Percy about his feelings, and in the last few pages forms a potentially romantic friendship with another boy. The issue is treated positively, and I can appreciate that a youth reading about what goes on in Nico''s head would give them an important perspective on how someone experiencing same-gender attraction might feel. Certainly the hope is that this will help them respond with an understanding heart when they encounter a similar situation in real life. However, as I expressed in my review on The House of Hades, I feel it was presumptuous of the author to present this sensitive topic in a children''s book without giving parents a chance to discuss it with their kids first.The Heroes of Olympus series is A LOT of fun! The last book was disappointing, but I''ll still be recommending the series to my children who are at least 11 or 12.

The humor that is infused into each book is my favorite part, even if it is corny. I''ve laughed harder at the Percy Jackson books than any other book series I''ve read.

I have enjoyed each book and hope to enjoy many more in the series although the author does pretty much wrap up everything with this book.  The Omega Force, if you''re just joining us now, is comprised of several aliens who have banded together to help others not able to defend themselves.  Captain Jason Burke; Twingo, Chief Engineer; Crusher, Security; Lucky, Security; Doc, Medical; and Kage, the co-pilo, are about as different from one another as can be, but they all have a grudging admiration for each others talents and together, the seem to be unstoppable.To me, these books are different because Jason Burke, the human, isn''t the weak link in this group.  He''s gone through a number of enhancements that have made him stronger, faster, and smarter.  That his body could put up with all these changes is a credit to the human race and pretty much astounds Doc Ma''Fredich.  He''s now the equal in physical combat to Crusher, who is a massive alien, all muscle, and bred for fighting.  He''s also a formable challenge to Lucky, who is a synthetic being made mostly of electronics and high density metal.  He''s also a walking computer, but Jason doesn''t necessarily have to rely on him for that purpose.  No, Lucky, is more a of mobile armor platform than anything else.  So, Jason is in charge and has proven himself on numerous occasions.Now, they are off on another mission to transport and archeologist to a former dig to pickup some equipment and an artifact that was left behind in her hasty departure.  Jason doesn''t really care what the archeologist needs to get or what she found as long as he gets paid up front.  But, once a the far distant empty dust-ball of a planetoid, he finds that she hasn''t told him everything, as usual.  He and his ship, the Phoenix find themselves being attacked by different factions for something they thing Jason''s ship contains.  Jason and Twingo, his Chief Engineer, have pretty much taken the Phoenix apart and can''t find anything of particular value or anything that shouldn''t be on the ship.  Then they bring this new artifact aboard and things start happening.The writing in these stories is so fluid.  It''s very easy to read on of these books and I kind of fly through them.  Fortunately, each book has been pretty long and that even ads to the story-line.  There is just a touch of humor also in the story which helps a lot.  It would seem to an outsider that Jason''s crew can''t stand each other, but as they are together on some lengthy space voyages, they constantly bicker to just keep themselves sane.  They all know that what they say doesn''t matter, it''s what they do that counts and no one ever gets left behind.  Jason can also figure out what''s going on with the people he helps and knows when he''s not being told the whole story.  It''s the same with this Archeologist.  Unfortunately for her, she gets caught in a lie that results in her death.  Jason isn''t really sorry about it, but if she had been honest from the start, it might have been prevented.So, another good science fiction book for you to read.  I''ve already bought the next one, "Omega Force: Redemption" and I''ll be enjoying it probably not long from now.', '2019-03-11 12:26:14.930797');

The dialog is funny, especially the interaction between Jason and the alien crew.  Having the crew pick up Jason''s use of profanity and human colouquisms is laugh out loud funny. You can almost picture them saying it. But not everything is fun and games however, in fact the book starts with Jason in a particularly bad situation, mostly due to his own carelessness.

There has also been the curiosity/hope from fans that one day, Dalzelle would get around to telling the story that he had hinted at. This is that story, what was Deetz getting at? What is the great mystery? What is the Secret of the Phoenix?No Spoilers – Sorry! But I will tell you that you will not see it coming, it is far bigger than what you expect, and Dalzelle has a flair for story telling that makes anything he writes well worth reading.It''s not just that he tells a great story that is fast paced, action packed with some wicked humour. Dalzelle goes to the effort to make sure that he has done the research so that his story is believable (for a Sci-Fi story obviously), that the tech is sound, that the story flows with his other books and is consistent etc. Having read several others in this genre, I hate it when you come across stuff that does not come up to scratch, when authors have not made the effort to make their technology plausible or within the bounds of physics. And this is where Authors like Dalzelle standout from the crowd.Added to that is his Characters. Whether it is these group of hooligans or those from his other series The Black Fleet Trilogy, his characters are written with such believable ease. By this I mean that you can easily relate to them, as you read about them, you can see them, understand their actions and behaviours as Dalzelle has made them easy to believe, even though a large majority of them are alien. And this is something that is difficult to do, take something that is alien, and still have us, the reader, relate to it. This is the mark of a good Author.One of the other great aspects of these books is that the story shifts quiet easily from a humorous note in which members of the crew are having a crack at each other, to rather serious or delicate situations, in which there are charged and emotional situations. Again, this is something that is difficult to do, especially after 6 books, it is difficult to keep it fresh, interesting and dynamic, and Dalzelle has not only managed this, but leaves you wanting more.Each book the characters have continued to develop, allowing us to explore them, but not so much that this becomes an in-depth character novel, as this is at the end of the day, the A-Team meets Firefly, meets Battlestar Galactica on Steroids. It''s about an action packed, full-on ride into whatever hell has been unleashed on the crew this time with some hilarious laughs along the way. And it''s possibly one of the best Sci-Fi reads of its genre out there.If you loved Firefly, Battlestar, or any of that type, this is definitely for you, and it just gets better with each book.', '2019-03-11 12:26:14.930797');

The competiveness between the "away team" of Crusher, Lucky and Jason, the interaction between those three and the more "nerdy" characters of Doc, Twingo and Cage. The best example is in the original Star Trek, the interactions between Kirk, McCoy and Spock were often laugh out loud funny, if you knew the characters.Joshua Dalzelle has put together an eclectic group of characters, that on the surface should not get along at all, and in the end they are like a family. I really like how things with Mazer and the Galvetic warriors have progressed as well. Bottom line for me is Book 8 could be "Omega Force: Trip to the grocery store" and because of the characters I am sure I would find it interesting and funny, This book tied up many loose ends, from the previous books in the series, and positioned the series for a whole new set of adventures.I was really happy when I read the authors notes at the end saying that he planned to write more than the seven that are already out, Also looking forward to reading "Call to Arms" which is the second book in the Black Fleet Trilogy - very different, but also very good.

The last review I completed was for OF4, I had a bit of moan about Jason Burke being too cavalier and not developing enough as a character. I was a little worried that I''d have to give up on the series if things didn''t change. So I was so happy that book 5 and now book 6 have given some of the main characters the growth they deserved. Jason has lost some of his urge to dive into situations with only the barest hint of a crayola sketch for a plan. He''s more measured, thoughtful and comfortable in himself. He also continues his relationship with Captain Kellea, only in a mature(ish) manner that we wouldn''t have previously seen. We also see changes in Crusher after his last adventure and to some extent Lucky.In this book Dalzelle puts to rest one of the main story arcs we''ve had hints of throughout the series. As the book title implies, the secret of the Phoenix is finally revealed. There is no clear enemy in this book, for the most part they''re shadowy forces trying to take what Omega Force unwittingly has. As usual there are plenty of firefights both on and off the ship. We get to see Mazer and his forces at work for the first time in their new role as well. The story concludes quite quickly,  and I would''ve liked to have seen it play out for a bit longer, also all I could think as I was reading was "that''s no moon!". I''m not sure, but there''s now a possibility of either the Confed playing a larger role in future novels, or possibly a new and highly aggressive species.This was a great read, I blitzed through it because it was so enjoyable. The usual humour, fun and action are all present. If you''ve read the previous novels you''ll definitely want this one. If you haven''t, then start the series at the beginning as there''s a definite timeline which should be followed.

However, the battle has uncovered an even more dangerous foe, a ship with the ability to jump in system, with possible cloaking technology, incredible firepower and manoeuvrability. The ship, designated as ‘Spectre'' is a renegade Darshik captain, and he appears to be one step ahead of the crew at every opportunity, taking out research stations, manufacturing and other vital resources that they cannot afford to lose.With no other options left, and before they can be stopped by a weak government, Wolfe is unleashed with the newest class of Destroyer to seek and destroy this threat permanently.This is a brilliant story, of a Captain, returning to the chair of a Warship, surrounded by crew that are not just loyal to him, but idolise him. Wolfe has grown so much through these stories, from the alcoholic misfit old Captain, bitter at his career and life, and distrusted and hated. Now he is the hero of Starfleet, revered amongst his peers, and thought of as one of their best strategical and tactical hopes against the enemy.One of the reasons that make Dalzelle''s books such a standout in this genre is his grasp and use of concepts such as orbital mechanics, astrophysics, starship combat and the list goes on. He uses these concepts to bring his stories to life, but give the reader the feeling that they are actually immersed in a real-time simulation, sitting with the crew as they have to wait the hours to drop down or climb up the well of a star-system, move to a hyperspace point etc, giving his books such a feel of realism, but not bogging them down in pages and pages of explanations so that the reader wants to throw themselves out the nearest airlock.The combination of exceptional characters and a skilful use of realism, added to an outstanding storyline, makes this one of the best reads in the genre.Destroyer is the culmination of not just the Expansion War Trilogy, but also the Black Fleet Trilogy, showing us how far Wolfe and Wright have developed in their careers, from the grumpy old drunk on the outer rim and the eager young officer, too eager to please and too shiny around the edges, as they are now, 2 of the finest Officers in the fleet with more combat experience than the rest of the fleet combined. The other character that has grown, and continues to grow on you (kind of like mould in a bathroom sink), is Pike. Pike''s character is still one of the best in this book, not just for his antics and amusing commentary, but the way he shows that no government or military can operate without an efficient spy organisation. His character provided some unique story arcs, but also gave some interesting side views into what might happen behind closed doors.This is another outstanding Sci-Fi thriller, and I can only hope that Dalzelle will continue to develop the series and give us another trilogy.

Humanity is still trying to pull itself together when it encounters yet more aliens. The new Aliens come with both an Ally, asking for help, and an enemy, a threat to the other Aliens, and to Humanity as well. Although not as powerful as the Phage, they have found their new enemy to be a dangerous threat. This is what makes these books such an interesting series, the detailed scope of the Universe we live in, the Political chessboard that Dalzelle has created, and the Military ramifications that result from the fallout. In the middle of all of this of course, is Dalzelle''s exceptional character''s, with Wright, Wolfe, Marcum, Pike just to name a few, and so many more.In this book, Wolfe is returned to command, and we get to see him in all his glory. Whilst there is still some political intrigue, some diplomatic games, there is a lot less of the manoeuvring that we saw in book 1.In this story, although Wolfe has been returned to command, the leadership desperate for the Political points it will win them when he is painted at being back out in the field, however, due to political games, he is given the Captain''s chair of an older Assault Class Frigate, rather than a Destroyer, leaving him with little in the way of options.He is then tasked with the impossible, to land his Assault Forces on a planet that is being laid siege to by the Darshik (the enemy Alien race), in a system that they currently have power over, both on the surface, and with superior forces in space. Numerous ships have already smashed against the blockade trying to get much needed resources to the surface. If Wolfe can''t do it, it is all over for Millions on the surface. To make matters worse, his escort, originally to be the one and only Celeste Wright, is changed at the last minute to a lesser commander who has very little actual combat experience, and refuses to listen to Jackson, again more politics with no thought at all for the Military ramifications. The brilliance of this is, that Dalzelle writes this so well, making this such a realistic story.What ensues is a totally gripping and captivating end game, as ‘The Lone Wolfe'' tries desperately to not only keep himself alive, he has to keep his crew, and that of the Assault force alive as well, and more importantly, he has to deliver them, for the fate of the entire planet rests on his shoulders now, possibly more, if the planet falls, it could be a staging area into the core next.The change from book 1 of the original series, in which Jackson Wolfe was a derided ‘Earther'', whom everyone loathed and hated, to the Legend he has become is fascinating to watch and read. The way the people on the planet react to hearing his name, and instantly fight that much harder, because the Legend of the Wolfe is here, the inspiration he brings, even that of Celeste Wright. Dalzelle has created these amazing characters, and they are not Gods are anything silly, they are figureheads, those kind of legends that people rally behind in times of war, that tales get told about (and exaggerated – Wolfe killed an Alpha with his bare hands...), but it is these legends that turn the tides of wars, battles and make the difference. It is obvious that Dalzelle has done his homework (or has a good understanding himself), of these concepts, as he writes them so well. It gives his stories such depth of character that you just don''t see in some others, making this all the better for it.This is a brilliant read, this series only continues to get better, and you should definitely get into it if you aren''t already.', '2019-03-11 12:26:14.930797');

Dalzelle states in the afterward that he is consciously shaping this particular trilogy to focus on a relatively limited aspect of the interaction (no, it''s not ALL fighting) between humans and other species, rather than making this yet another life-or-death-of-the-species struggle.Significantly, Dalzelle does a notably good job of keeping the storyline free of the sort of political or ethical commentary that is all too common in the science fiction genre.If you enjoy this series, you''ll probably also enjoy the Ember War Saga by Richard Fox.', '2019-03-11 12:26:14.930797');

Makes for interesting reading though.It seems to me that with their regeneration machine, the military would rely on a lot less people knowing that the ones dying will be coming back in a little while.  I guess you just have to keep the current battle going long enough for the recycling to get done!  Man, what a way to fight!McGill gets a lot of attention in this story.  He puts himself in a lot of situation where he shouldn''t be but is lucky enough to figure a way out of his trouble usually without getting himself killed, usually.  Now that he''s a big gun guy, he gets to lead from the front most of the time.  That''s not the best place to be but he manages most of the time.I think the story line is pretty good.

I just don''t understand how these Marines can die and just come back for more.  Even if they have a "bad" death, they come back for more as if nothing strange had happened.  That''s kind of what this book is about, how Veteran McGill dies.This mission starts off pretty gruesome.  McGill and his entire Legion Cohort plus others are standing on a parade field which is other wise a spaceport landing pad.  They are waiting for the first shipment of rare ore being brought from Metal World.  Unfortunately, the ship enters the Earth''s atmosphere without much intent on braking.  It splatters the thirty-thousand or so Legionaries on the tarmac and kills a huge amount of civilians there for the ceremonies.  Included in that bunch is James McGills parents!So, after being revived, Veteran McGill is on a mission for revenge.  They initially don''t know who did what, but later find out that the cargo ship was attacked by someone just as it came out of warp-space.  Legion Varus was aboard the Minotaur which was following a very weak trail leading to the far edge of space.  This was out where the squids lived and beyond the Empires reach.  Still, they hoped to find the perpetrators before they left known space, but there was no assurance they could get that done.Since the mission had been thrown together so quickly, a lot of heavy equipment had to be left behind.  They only had some armor and their weapons but nothing like their heavy Dragons.  It was hoped that whomever they met wouldn''t put up much resistance.  Fat chance of that!  As soon as they found a suspect planet and went into orbit, and immediately they were attacked.Now, the other piece of equipment that was barely brought was just one of their revival machines.  Yes, that''s the alien technology that uses human protomass to bring back the dead!  Doesn''t that sound wonderful?  If you haven''t been following this story line, then you''re going to be lost pretty quickly.  See, you can get killed any way possible and as gruesome as possible, but as long as someone acknowledges your death, you can be regenerated in a new body!  Your memory and "sole" are stored digitally constantly.  Once you die and enough protomass is available, you get a new body in which they download your memory and "sole".  The thing is, your new body is recorded occasionally at a young age and that''s what you get when you''re regenerated.  You''re young age, but with all your previous memories.Yeah, remember, you have all those memories of how you died and just died in your new brain.  It''s a wonder these people  don''t go screaming nuts as soon as they''re aware of where they are. And, if the revival machine is ever destroyed, then you are permanently dead.  Now, you can also be "permed" if the powers-that-be decide they no longer need your services or you''ve committed such a serious crime as to warrant being permed.Veteran McGill has done all of it.  He should have been permed a  long time ago, but he is such a crafty guy that he always manages to make it back to life.  But, remember, this book is titled "Death World".  With only one revival machine and their ship already under attack, it''s going to be a long mission and it might require you staying alive as long as possible.  I don''t think that''s possible for McGill.  Too many people want him dead!This again is another great book in this series.  I believe it will continue so that''s good.

Having finished this last book in the series (to date), I am impressed with the author''s ability to write a well conceived plot about a man who displays character (in the ethical sense) while at his most irreverent misadventures...thereby calling into question what defines a man''s character.Making the series even more enjoyable are the impish flaws of McGill''s personality, which make each book a much more entertaining journey than can be captured by this review. His character portrayal is at times antisocial, other times narcissistic, but always with the best of intentions...leading the reader to ponder on the concept that it is not our faults which define us, but rather what we do with them that gets us ahead...and McGill''s smart character does a lot.While some of the characters'' names resemble their less heralded attributes (eg. Claver is too clever for his own good, Graves is too grave to dance with the other schemers in the books, yet all the women in the books have proper names), this did not come across as a tacky pun but rather read consistent with McGills personality and thereby added style, intentional or not.Overall, I found that behind this series'' lighthearted facade and romp through sci fi oriented creativity, it also whispers quiet questions to the reader about the nature of character (in the ethical sense), character (in the personality sense), and character (in the development of a style sense). Forgive me if my writing style is thick, I do not have Mr. Larson''s playful imaginings...and my estimation of this series is that there is much more to it than meets the eye because his writing is pleasantly understated.

James McGill is now an officer, learning to lead the remorseless trained killers and now responsible for his platoon, which puts a damper on his individual heroics (or so we expect).  His Nemeses, the renegades Claver and Turov, return (and keep returning) to steal leadership of Earth''s forces and surrender Mankind to the squid slavers.  McGill and his troops must overcome these lurkers, the squids, and other foes to find a way to preserve Earth and her worlds from subjugation, "editing", or extermination - before the Galactics return and attempt to permanently kill him for official mischief (again).The book is written well, with good depth and interaction of the main characters.  The antagonist races take on more depth and context for their interstellar position and actions.  Earth''s delicate position takes on more context, balanced among unfriendly neighbors, suspicious Galactic bureaucrats, and unscrupulous human leaders.  McGill and his platoon members have more personal depth now, building in new layers of depth, motivation, and fears.  McGill begins emerging from his brash, glib role as a rogue and loose cannon - he has more responsibility than he bargained for!  Claver and Turov remain enigmas, with tantalizing glimpses into their ultimate motivations.I rated this at four stars - good book, but I began looking (early and often) for what the McGuffin (Galactic key) would enable this time.  The threat of perming gets kind of thin, as major characters are supposedly killed out but return a chapter or so later.  Characters who appear to be out of range for revival also return, with minimal reason for this.  Unfortunately, this telegraphed some of the surprises.  McGill saves much of the day, but the actions and methods get a bit strained.  The denouement is where one of the major twists comes in, setting the stage for several future books.One of the places for future revelation is just how deep one must dig to uncover Claver''s true masters and his hidden refuges.  He went from a sleazy minor character to some one more elusive and challenging than Professor Moriarity.

Our main character, James McGill, is a Legionnaire with the Legion Varus.  How he stays in this legion is the real mystery.  See, James McGill isn''t one to follow orders or the rules. He does what James McGill thinks is right and then sorts out the consequences later.As I mentioned, dying is part of the job for Legionnaries, especially for Legion Varus.  But, dying doesn''t necessarily mean "dead".  The Legion has an alien machine which takes organic matter and converts it into a new human with the downloading of that persons most recent memories!  Out of this machine pops a fresh human.  This copy has all the memories of its previous body up until they were killed!  That to me is really gruesome.  I mean dying is bad enough, especially if it was a violent death, but remembering how you just died who put a lot of people in the insane asylum!  It''s just not something you''d want to remember.James McGill has been in the Legion awhile.  This will be his fourth world that he and the Legion Varus have been assigned a mission to do something.  In every past mission, James McGill has been killed several times.  He hopes that won''t happen this time and he tries his hardest to make that happen.  Except things always go wrong for McGill.Because he has been an impressive Legionnaire when he''s fighting, he''s up for promotion to Veteran.  This is like an NCO position and has to be vetted through the other Legion Vets, none of which like James McGill.  They all think he thinks too much and they wind up paying for it.

So often in military SciFi there is neglect of character development.  I find this protagonist very refreshing. So often this individual has a heroic persona. In contrast James McGill is a very human, flawed character.  He does not have unlimited wisdom and prescience.  But instead he acts out of his basic "common sense" and personal code of conduct. Yes, the outcomes are often statistically improbable but not out of the realm of plausibility. And thus do not throw me out of the story.Another angle I find refreshing is the way "immortality" is dealt with in this series.  There are so many stories out now essentially exploring the same questions dealing with the tiresome nature of living forever.  This series takes a completely different approach that again is both refreshing and plausible.  It uses immortality as a tool rather than making it the theme of the series.This is the first time I have stopped and put fort the effort to write a review.  I wouldn''t say this ranks among the all-time-greats of SciFi.

Blood World advanced the story but seemed to drag at times. Dark World was on point, fun and quick paced. I read the whole thing in less than two days. It was great. That said, it''s not perfect and highlights future concerns more than anything else; Insofar as certain aspects are clearly formulaic which in some respects is both this story''s superpower and super-weakness. It''s similar to reading a video game where the main character can just "re-spawn" after screwing up. It is my belief this hurts rather than helps at times as it can be a "god in the box" crutch. Death should be avoided, unexpected and absolutely necessary, in this adventure it was. His sacrifice at the space station had meaning, well done. With further regards to character development, I''m glad to see McGill got his rank back.  However, at this point in the series, one would think he''d be moving up not the other "less" competent or rather incompetent ones around or above him. He was a King in the last novel, by now you''d think he''d be a general or lieutenant colonel or such but he seems stuck as a captain or it''s Roman equivalent. In many respects this is the essence of the problem, it''s time for this series to grow and perhaps stopping the "rinse and repeat" aspect that''s been successful so far but is beginning to wear a bit thin. That said Death World is like a cupcake sweet satisfying and even mildly nutritious but a diet of cupcakes would be nauseating over time. It''s time to go to the "next level" to maintain my video game analogy. The threat needs to be greater, the consequences harsher, the losses more painful and end result more substantial. I''m interested in "the eaters of lotus" thread. I want to see a human stellar empire emerge. I want to know Etta''s ok or at least, what''s happened. I might even like to see McGill find the "right" girl for him, though I love his strong male independence. I don''t want to keep going in circles though. It''s time to grow strong, build a navy, control the 300 worlds outright and trim some character fat (i.e. deaths). I like Carlos but he needs to grow or die and the same can be said for a host of other ancillary characters as well. End the Cleaver threat already. I don''t so much care what world McGill goes to next, a water world, an ice one, heck an terrain one would be fine as long as there''s substantive growth and development.

At one point, the ship and the away crew cannot communicate, because the distance would require 16 minutes for radio waves to travel back and forth. A short while later, the exact same parries are talking in real time. When it comes to communications in the massive battle, there is no lag time at all.

Then there is the ancient artifact aspect, which offers opportunity for new ideas...or old ones, this is an "ancient" artifact after all. There is also a potential love interest for the thus-far barren Captain Barron, though as with all the rest of the introspection, we get way too much of Barron''s "does he or doesn''t he" see-saw of emotion.

He has written a ton of military science fiction and this one is just as good, if not better, than the rest.  I actually have Book 4, "Echoes of Glory" and Book 5, "Cauldron of Fire", and some how I bought them before I bought book 3.  But, now I''m caught up and have some additional great reading to do.Now on with the review of this book.  We''re back with Captain Tyler Barron, commanding the CFS Dauntless.  His ship and crew have just slightly recovered from their ordeal behind enemy lines where they destroyed a massive Union floating supply depot with the help of the CFS Intrepid.  While there was a lull in the fighting, the war was still going on and the Confederation was just waiting for what the Union might do next.  Although the Confederation believed it would take a while for the Union to amass enough forces to make a concentrated attack, they still had to stay vigilant.  But, several battleships had to get refitted or they were going to fall completely apart.  The CFS Dauntless was one of those.So, to the pleasant surprise of Captain Tyler Barron and his crew, they were ordered back to the shipyards on Dannith for extended repairs.  Why there was something of a mystery since that particular shipyard was very far in the rear and near the "Badlands", a sector of space where previous civilizations had existed until they destroyed each other.  The Badlands was a strange and eerie place where worlds have died.  Destruction was very evident all around the planets and the space in-between.  These civilizations had reached a technology level far in advanced of the current humans, but it had led to their total annihilation.  Very few artifacts existed in this strange place and it was forbidden for spacers to travel to this sector although that brought out the worst in humanity called scavengers.  They chose to roam the Badlands scavenging bits and pieces of old tech that they sold on the blackmarket.  Most of this old stuff was of no use and little more than junk.  The tech was also so far advanced that most who got some didn''t know what it was or what to do with it.Then the spaceship Pegasus found something far into the Badlands.  It was a monumental fine that could change the balance of power in the galaxy.  The only problem is they didn''t know how to get it back to Confederation space and even if they did, they knew the Confeds would confiscate their find and probably throw them in prison.  Still, this massive find could not be ignored.  Then the Union showed up using the same purchased information that Captain Andromeda Lafarge of the Pegasus had obtained.  For once, Captain Lafarge put her loyalty to the Confederation ahead of her personal desires and knew that the Confederation had to get control of this massive artifact before the Union took it with them.The only problem of the Confederation was that the Union chose this time to launch a new offensive.  It couldn''t be determined initially if this was a decisive attack meant to go all out or if it was a bluff.  The Confed Admiral felt that he needed every ship in the fleet available for the coming battle, but with the CFS Dauntless on it''s way to Dannith, he decided to send it into the Badlands to find out just what the Pegasus and it''s Captain had found.  The odds are stacked against the Dauntless once again.  It doesn''t look good for the Confederation at either the front or in the Badlands.  A very exciting story unfolds.  Fast paced action with lots of great reading.I''m thinking about reading book four immediately, but I might not.  I can guarantee that I will get back to this series very soon.

Unless one is trained to deal specifically with threats and stressful situations such as this, one quickly hands over the wallet or the purse. No sophisticated time intensive algorithms are in play in this situation. The pattern matching of the gun image and the affective capabilities of the brain take over here, provoking with incredible speed an appropriate fear response. The feedback received from this situation is that of walking away unscathed.The point to be made here is that if one is to view the brain as a computational entity that deploys various algorithms to deal with situations like this and survival in general one must come to grips with the computational complexity of these algorithms. One must acknowledge that survival entails in many instances that thought processes operate on time scales that can are very short, as well as time scales that can be very long, i.e. require much deliberation and a quantitative assessment of risks.The author of this book is well aware of the issues with computational complexity and via the idea (which he invented) of ‘probably approximately correct'' or PAC learning for short, has given the evolutionary biologists an interesting and provocative view of evolutionary processes that addresses some of the gaps in the Darwinian paradigm.The book is highly interesting and its perusal will not only help the reader understand the issues at stake in the Darwinian view of evolution but will also assist the uninitiated reader in the understanding of PAC learning itself. In this regard the author devotes a portion of the book to PAC learning and examples are given that illustrate it. A very plausible case for the role of PAC learning in evolutionary process is outlined and should be understandable to anyone with even a modest background in computer science and mathematical logic. Readers with more background in learning theory and artificial intelligence can still appreciate the book even though the rigorous formalism has been omitted in order to appeal to a wider audience.Whatever the eventual impact this book has on evolutionary biology it raises issues that should be addressed when contemplating the Darwinian paradigm, and beyond that it addresses requirements that every algorithm developer confronts in everyday practice. These involve the running time of algorithms designed for practical use, the data needed for these algorithms that can frequently be corrupted or sparse, and the overhead generated by the algorithm, especially those deployed on information networks.', '2019-03-11 12:26:14.930797');

I really enjoyed the setting, themes, characters, and world-building which took what was already a surprisingly deep video game then expanded it into a truly rich setting. The fact the people at Bungie and later 343 Industries have chosen to let Eric Nylund''s work become influences for the canon games shows their awareness of their IP as well as willingness to let all parts of it be important. The Fall of Reach''s premise is, essentially, the backstory of John-117, the Spartan program, and the Covenant War. We begin the book with the human race locked in a civil war between the Earth''s government and Insurrectionists. Doctor Elizabeth Halsey believes she can solve this war with the creation of super-soldiers which will be able to do pinpoint infiltration and attacks that could end the war. Unfortunately, the process to create these transhumans requires children to be taken from their families and raised as soldiers from pre-adolescence. Worse, not all of them will survive. It''s a bold choice to start the story with a primary point of view character doing something so morally abhorent but Eric Nylund makes Doctor Halsey surprisingly sympathetic throughout. While treating the Spartans initially as nothing more than test subjects, she gradually comes to view them as beings akin to her children. Doctor Halsey''s relationship with the Spartans would eventually be expanded upon in Halo 4, Halo: Spartan Ops, and Halo 5. Co-starring in the book are William Keyes, future Pillar of Autumn Captain, and the Master Chief himself. William Keyes serves as a model Naval officer, divorced from the moral ambiguities of the Spartan Program and eager to make up for past failures. The Master Chief is an interesting mix of child and soldier, having been deprived of anything resembling a childhood but adapting by treating his missions like giant capture the flag sessions. Which is, given how Halo multiplayer became a lifestyle among gamers, kind of hilarious. The war against the Insurrectionists doesn''t last long, though, and the Earth soon finds itself encountering a hostile alien presence which seems obsessed with nothing less than the genocide of the human race. They destroy colony after colony with a ruthless abandon, washing over humanity''s defenses as if they didn''t even exist. The Covenant of the video games is often portrayed semi-humorously with the comical Grunts and their colorful attire but the one in the books is pure nightmare fuel. They are genocidal, horrific, and unstoppable with a technological edge that utterly dwarfs humanity''s own. The supporting characters like Chief Mendez, Cortana, Linda, and Ensign Lowell help enrich the storyline as the clock ticks down to the inevitable final confrontation with the Covenant at Reach. None of the characters but the main three are particularly well-developed but they aren''t two-dimensional either and I developed an attachment to quite a few. Some of them, like Mendez, will go on to have big roles in the Expanded Universe as a whole. As the title shows, there''s no happy ending for this book and many of the Spartans we''ve come to care about will perish defending a planet which the Covenant will take no matter what. The book isn''t exactly All Quiet on the Western Front but the tragic battle ultimately inspired Halo: Reach and one of the series'' most well-received titles. I will state for fans of Reach, though, that the book does not depict the battle of the game which retconned many of the events inside. The book shows a battle which lasted a few hours, maybe a day, while the game depicts a almost a week of fighting. It should be noted the original book has since been updated since its initial release and contains several changes, additional content, and conversations to bring it more in line with existing Halo canon. I don''t think these changes added very much since the book was already impressive as is. If you want an excellent piece of popcorn military fiction then you could do much worse than this book as well as the subsequent two volumes in the trilogy.', '2019-03-11 12:26:14.930797');

I think this is the first thing I''ve read by Nylund, but I have to say it won''t be the last. His pacing is great, the world building remarkable, but it''s the story of Master Chief becoming Master Chief, and how the SPARTAN program began with Dr. Halsey that really captured me.John-117 and the original Spartans were not volunteers; they were scouted out and taken as children, told they were being drafted, and could never return home again. Essentially, they were propagandized and brainwashed to obey orders without question. Then came the really appalling medical treatments that ended up killing or maiming seventy of the original draftees.Up to this point UNSC was not engaged with the Covenant, but the Spartans were going to be created to battle insurgencies, uprisings, piracy, and the like. To me, this makes Dr. Halsey pretty immoral as the program was extreme and these were children they were putting through.That said, when the Covenant did show up and start glassing human worlds, the Spartan program would have been completely justified. From the first attack about twenty years pass and John-117 and the other Spartans have proven their worth and are already mythical.The Spartans were sent to Sigma Ocanus IV due to the build up of Covenant forces and the fact that they hadn''t left. A large Marine contingent was sent to defend the planet, but were almost totally wiped out. John-117 sent them off with the Pelican as he and the others set out on their mission to nose around and find out what they were looking for.During their mission they record video of a new species which is standing orders, and discover that the Covenant is massed inside a Natural History Museum. In the sewers they find a way inside, tripping a motion sensor, and a squad of Jackals came in and the Spartans mopped them up. They follow some massive bloody footprints to another room, discovering another new species, Hunters. The Hunters were protecting a  rock that was being scanned and sent to space. With a lot of effort they take out the Hunters collect the rock, and destroy the device sending the signal to space.As the other squads check in, they determine there''s human presence left in the city, and following orders, they nuke it, destroying all of the Covenant forces. During an interrogation by ONI about the mission, they were peeved that he destroyed the city and what more the Covenant might have been interested in, thus more intelligence about the Covenant. John fired back that his orders were very specific and that they came out of ONI. That peeved them even more.The rock they collected contained lots of different symbols, none of which they understood. As Reach was falling, Cortana – who only recently met, and chose John – had those symbols running and John mentioned he''d seen similar images on a Covenant ship.

You knew it was wrong for humanity in the grand scheme of things, but you could also see why colonists behaved as they did.There was also some insight into the Covenant and how unequal the members are.  The Grunts are treated like stupid cattle, their breeding restricted, and have little to no say in things.  On the other hand, you can see why that''s probably a good thing given their intellect and penchence for over breeding.  It''s just another little minor thing, but it was a really nice touch to give you a chance to weigh the morality.  Again, things aren''t all black and white.

The setting is a book, comic, and video game series featuring military characters doing battle with an alien theocracy known as the Covenant. The Kilo-5 novels, which starts with Glasslands, chronicles the events following Halo 3 when the Master Chief has disappeared, the Covenant has been defeated, and an uneasy peace exists between humanity with the various former Covenant races.  The premise is the Office of Naval Intelligence (ONI) has decided to start arming insurgent alien religious groups with weapons to rise up against the strongest remaining Covenant state. Admiral Parangosky, leader of ONI, believes this is the only way to guarantee humanity''s survival against future aggression despite the current leadership being friendly with humanity. Given the author Karen Traviss'' familiarity with real-life blowback from doing the same with the future Taliban during the Soviet-Afghanistan War, I can only assume the foolishness of this action was deliberate.  Meanwhile, Doctor Catherine Halsey is marooned with a group of Spartans on a Forerunner shield-world, unaware of the events of Halo 3. Doctor Halsey is attempting to make up for her crimes in creating the original Spartans by protecting them from the destruction of the galaxy at the hands of the Flood. Not knowing this has been prevented, the group slowly begins turning against her as Chief Mendez vents his decades of guilt over the same project she''s trying to atone for. It gets worse for Doctor Halsey as Captain Serin Osman, a Spartan-II program "washout", plots revenge against her for the kidnapping and body-horror she endured.  As these events go on, Sangheili (one of the Covenant races) Jul''mdama has grown to hate and loathe humanity. Refusing to believe his current government''s path is the right one, he chooses to ally with the very same religious fanatics currently being armed by ONI. It''s a twisted collection of plots, subplots, and counter-plots which all come together in a prequel for the events of Halo 4.  What''s interesting is all of this is built on the organic foundation of Halo''s politics and faction rather than anything typical of video game sci-fi like ancient artifacts or some dastardly villain setting plans in motion. It all flows from the fact, post-Halo 3, just about everyone working together to defeat the Prophet of Truth and Flood still hated each other.  I''ve been a big fan of Karen Traviss and her writing since her days writing for the Star Wars Expanded Universe. I loved her Republic Commando books and even had a neat little pen-pal relationship with her on RPG.net for a short while. I even sent her a package of my books back when I was a very-very crappy writer. Hehe. While I didn''t always agree with her portrayal of characters in those books, I''ve rarely met an author who was nicer to her fans. I also felt she was a great fit for the Haloverse as she does excellent military science-fiction depictions.  The Kilo-5 team is an interesting collection of individuals and I have to say I enjoyed spending time with them. I enjoyed how they''re able to wrap themselves in the comforting warmth of patriotism and doing what was necessary even as the narrative makes it clear they''re somewhat deluding themselves. As we see in Halo 4, their actions will have terrible consequences for humanity but they trust their superiors to know what they''re doing even as the book slowly unravels that trust.  I was particularly fond of Spartan-II Naomi who came off as an adorable cutie despite being raised as a supersoldier. I also enjoyed the character of Black Box as the A.I. vacillated between ruthlessly manipulative and supportive. Captain Osman is also a somewhat tragic character as she has allied herself with ONI out of misguided rage and personal loyalty but the consequences of such may well be her becoming the same sort of person who created her tragedy in the first plans.  Some fans may have difficulty with the treatment of fan favorite Doctor Halsey who is called out repeatedly for her kidnapping of children to create the Spartans. I believe Karen Traviss is aware of just how hypocritical Chief Mendez and Admiral Parangosky are being, though, attempting to project guilt from their own sins on her.  Indeed, Doctor Halsey says Mendez''s remorse is an illusion since he repeated the crime without her a decade later. Much of the book depends on irony and self-justification which is something which fits into spy fiction as we see everyone attempting to play off their shady deals as the right thing to do, no matter how dishonorable or brutal those actions may be. The other guy is always bad and thus anything done to them is justified.  I especially liked that we got into Doctor Halsey''s head about the fact she''s just lost her daughter, Miranda Keyes, and that she doesn''t have any beliefs or remaining loved ones to provide her comfort during this time. The fact the UNSC is turning on her during this just makes it a double gut-punch. Doctor Halsey may have done some awful things but she was a humanized character and the engine which enabled her actions moves on without her. Some of the writing is overwrought with Doctor Halsey talking about being a soulless being but I can''t help but assume she''s confronting her own guilt.  This is a entertaining military science fiction novel but sometimes goes a bit overboard in depicting its characters reactions. I think they''d be a bit more subdued personally with their self-righteousness given the moral ambiguities of their work but, despite this, I think it was really entertaining and encourage Halo fans to pick up the trilogy before playing Halo 4.9/10', '2019-03-11 12:26:14.930797');

I was hoping it was a case where I would enjoy it even if others haven''t. Honestly, it is the worst Halo novel I''ve read. I own and love all the Halo novels before this one including the Forerunner Saga. However, Karen Traviss took what we had known about the characters from the previous novels and completely threw it away. I''m not sure how people can actually like this book, because of this fact.Others have written about the flaws of this book, but here are a few points I have to get off my chest.[Spoilers]Halsey is basically the devil incarnate in this novel series. I understand Halsey did morally outrageous acts. However, she is made with such a lack of dimension in this book; she comes across as a comic book villain. Nothing is really said about the fact that she did actually care about her Spartan-IIs. To an extent at which someone like her could. In real life extremely smart people often have problems relating to others, especially those with less intelligence. I, for instance, am not extremely intelligent, but smart enough that when I see people doing stupid things all around me it gets on my nerves. So, I can almost relate. I just take my annoyances and multiply them, a lot.Even Chief Mendez turns on Halsey. When Halsey fires back about the Spartan-IIIs, he defends himself by saying they were volunteers and that basically wins the argument. Nothing is said about how the Spartan-IIIs were created for suicide missions and that they were culled from orphans. Also the fact that they were very young, which means even if the "volunteered" they were still just children, Another fact is that the augmentations for Spartan-IIs wouldn''t have worked well with ordinary people, that is why they chose the people with the best genes. It was only later that the procedures were improved which lead to higher success rates and they probably wouldn''t have been able to improve them if Halsey hadn''t created the Spartan-IIs in the first place. Finally, the Spartan-IIIs were given increased aggression that could interfere with rational though if not kept in check, Mendez was an intelligent soldier. He maybe haunted by his actions, but based on the previous novels I believe that he would have known he had no moral high ground to stand on. If he had even been moved to blame Halsey anyway. However, Traviss apparently decided that these points were unimportant and she just needed yet another character to bash Halsey with.I liked Lucy in Ghosts of Onyx, but in this story she became yet another victim of the idea that everyone must hate Halsey. She ends up punching Halsey and freeing herself of her psychological muteness, because Halsey was badgering an Engineer? How does this make sense? I doubt Halsey would have be so abrasive with it. Sure she can be abrasive, but the scenario just felt like it was written just so Lucy would attack her. As I was reading it I remember thinking, Halsey wouldn''t be acting like this and Lucy probably wouldn''t be getting so angry either.I don''t know how anyone can actually care about Kilo-Five. The ODSTs came off as idiots. Osman is a washed out Spartan-II who has been brainwashed by Parangosky, who is nothing better than a personal enemy of Halsey. In fact, she new everything about the Spartan-II project, because it was an ONI project. She also has no moral high ground, but is quick to dispense judgement. Osman is the same, because she was trained by Parangosky to hate Halsey, even though Kilo-Five''s entire mission is a deplorable atrocity. Instead of helping their number one supporter Thel ''Vadam, they help his opponents. Apparently, they want the Elites to remain in chaos, but they basically enable the anti-humanist faction and maybe even instigated the next war between Humans and Elites. I doubt Jul ''Mdama would have been able to come to power over the Elite splinter factions and cause so much chaos later.Traviss doesn''t seem to know the definition of Top Secret, Classified information, or need to know basis. She has Osman tell the ODSTs everything about the Spartan-II program. Well, almost everything, since it is all a manipulation on Traviss'' part to make the characters hate Halsey. The ODSTs did not need to know about any of it to accomplish they mission. I don''t care if Osman wanted to create a bond with her team or some such thing, that wouldn''t have happened. That''s all I have to say about that.Traviss'' seems to grasp the concept of black ops enough to try to write a book about a black ops team. However, a key point bought up to make Halsey look even more devious was the flash cloning of the Spartan-II children. Supposedly, Halsey authorized this herself without permission, which is doubtful to begin with. Somehow, this was an unnecessary evil, because the parents thought their kids had died when the clone deteriorated. It was a calculated maneuver, not some personal whim Halsey tacked on to her highly detailed, Top Secret program. By making clones, there isn''t going to be 75 missing children investigations. If someone manages to see a Spartan-II and recognize them as the child, they are more likely to dismiss them as just looking similar, because they "know" that child is dead. These are just two very good reasons for the flash clones. THe book indicates one person suspecting the flash clone not being his child. That is better than seventy-five entire families looking for their loved ones. Frankly, I view Parangosky as an idiot if she is head of the most secretive department in human civilization and not realizing this.Traviss even has Parangosky rub in the fact to Halsey that Colonel Ackerson died a hero. I''m glad he did something redeemable. However, he tried to kill John-117 and Cortana in the training ground just to prove Halsey wrong. Also, he started the suicidal Spartan-III program largely as Halsey''s rival. He had few redeeming qualities, but of course Traviss tries to make him look better than Halsey.Halsey did some very terrible actions, but she did them because many people thought there was going to be a massive war between Humans. She was authorized by ONI. She made smart, calculated, if cold decisions. However she is far from Mengele, as Traviss heavily tried to point out. Mengele did experiments because he could and didn''t care if they succeeded or the patients survived as long as he got information from them. He wanted to further the German race as he viewed it. Halsey had a purpose for her experiments and tried to make sure they were successful with minimum casualties and she thought she was furthering the entire Human race. Considering this idea of augmenting Humans was still in it''s infancy, she did rather well and paved the way for Spartan-IIIs, Spartan-IVs, and perhaps eventually all of humanity.[End Spoilers]Karen Traviss does manage to get details right, but she glosses over them if they don''t fit here overall scheme. So this book was a huge disappointment. I was looking forward to seeing the post war galaxy, but it was drowned out by Traviss'' own agenda, blatant disregard of previous character''s personalities, and dislike of certain characters.', '2019-03-11 12:26:14.930797');

Instead there is only 2 pages that have any actual detail, and the rest of the time the "AI" is just there to crack jokes.I really wish this book could be redacted from Halo cannon, since it appears the sole purpose is to vent the hatred the author has at the idea of the spartans, and how horrible people we are for liking the story and game about them.', '2019-03-11 12:26:14.930797');

I read the book and was very confused with the plot and the writing style. I didn''t like all the subterfuge and the plotting against the Elites when they were supposed to be our allies. That''s my personal opinion however, I could be wrong, I personally liked having the Elites on our side at the end of Halo 3 and would want to keep helping them afterwards. However this isn''t a Halo 3 review so let me keep this about the book.I got excited when the book started to go into the story of the other Spartans and looked forward to some action going on that I''m used to seeing when there are the UNSC''s greatest troops involved. However for the majority of the book they are pretty much used as bodyguards and are just there for show, telling the crew about their past. I don''t agree with this. This book brings out too many emotions that is just completely out of character for the Spartans. I dont expect everyone or even hardly anyone to agree with the way the Dr. Halsey created the Spartans before the war started but hey, she did it and that fact turned the tide of the Covenant War to our favor and that fact alone. I think there is just too much hate pointed at Dr. Halsey and it just doesn''t seem right to me.Also, in my opinion, I was expecting a good action novel to go with the returning of (SPOILER) the Spartans we left off in Onyx, and something exciting happening with Naomi. However, I was wrong and a little let down. The book mainly focuses on ONI and it''s straight plotting against our now allies and I dont agree with that. This is supposed to be an action saga and the fact that it has been brought down to dirty tricks and knives in the back, it just kinda sucks.

Some of the writing confused me at times,  take for example this oddity written when a spartan and ODST try to awkwardly communicate."Everyone in uniform griped all the time. It was one of those fundamental things that bonded ships and armies. When the griping stopped, officers worried." Oh so every UNSC soldier just needs to gripe and moan as much as Dr.Halsey does about everything and morale will be through the roof! C''mon, these are tough as nails, highly trained soldiers, they bond through thrills and kills not freaking gossiping.There are also way too many stories going on at one time and none of them feel fleshed out. The only character that I felt got the most treatment was Dr. Halsey, and it wasn''t good. Halsey goes from a motherly-genius-professional to a whiny-emo-hopeless-wreck.

He says he has had a "crush" on Percy for a long time. We learn that the reason he stays distant and keeps to himself is because of his heartache and shame.

He tells Percy about his feelings, and in the last few pages forms a potentially romantic friendship with another boy.

Certainly the hope is that this will help them respond with an understanding heart when they encounter a similar situation in real life. However, as I expressed in my review on The House of Hades, I feel it was presumptuous of the author to present this sensitive topic in a children''s book without giving parents a chance to discuss it with their kids first.The Heroes of Olympus series is A LOT of fun!

I really enjoyed the setting, themes, characters, and world-building which took what was already a surprisingly deep video game then expanded it into a truly rich setting. The fact the people at Bungie and later 343 Industries have chosen to let Eric Nylund''s work become influences for the canon games shows their awareness of their IP as well as willingness to let all parts of it be important. The Fall of Reach''s premise is, essentially, the backstory of John-117, the Spartan program, and the Covenant War. We begin the book with the human race locked in a civil war between the Earth''s government and Insurrectionists. Doctor Elizabeth Halsey believes she can solve this war with the creation of super-soldiers which will be able to do pinpoint infiltration and attacks that could end the war. Unfortunately, the process to create these transhumans requires children to be taken from their families and raised as soldiers from pre-adolescence. Worse, not all of them will survive. It''s a bold choice to start the story with a primary point of view character doing something so morally abhorent but Eric Nylund makes Doctor Halsey surprisingly sympathetic throughout. While treating the Spartans initially as nothing more than test subjects, she gradually comes to view them as beings akin to her children. Doctor Halsey''s relationship with the Spartans would eventually be expanded upon in Halo 4, Halo: Spartan Ops, and Halo 5. Co-starring in the book are William Keyes, future Pillar of Autumn Captain, and the Master Chief himself. William Keyes serves as a model Naval officer, divorced from the moral ambiguities of the Spartan Program and eager to make up for past failures. The Master Chief is an interesting mix of child and soldier, having been deprived of anything resembling a childhood but adapting by treating his missions like giant capture the flag sessions. Which is, given how Halo multiplayer became a lifestyle among gamers, kind of hilarious. The war against the Insurrectionists doesn''t last long, though, and the Earth soon finds itself encountering a hostile alien presence which seems obsessed with nothing less than the genocide of the human race. They destroy colony after colony with a ruthless abandon, washing over humanity''s defenses as if they didn''t even exist. The Covenant of the video games is often portrayed semi-humorously with the comical Grunts and their colorful attire but the one in the books is pure nightmare fuel. They are genocidal, horrific, and unstoppable with a technological edge that utterly dwarfs humanity''s own. The supporting characters like Chief Mendez, Cortana, Linda, and Ensign Lowell help enrich the storyline as the clock ticks down to the inevitable final confrontation with the Covenant at Reach. None of the characters but the main three are particularly well-developed but they aren''t two-dimensional either and I developed an attachment to quite a few. Some of them, like Mendez, will go on to have big roles in the Expanded Universe as a whole. As the title shows, there''s no happy ending for this book and many of the Spartans we''ve come to care about will perish defending a planet which the Covenant will take no matter what. The book isn''t exactly All Quiet on the Western Front but the tragic battle ultimately inspired Halo: Reach and one of the series'' most well-received titles. I will state for fans of Reach, though, that the book does not depict the battle of the game which retconned many of the events inside. The book shows a battle which lasted a few hours, maybe a day, while the game depicts a almost a week of fighting. It should be noted the original book has since been updated since its initial release and contains several changes, additional content, and conversations to bring it more in line with existing Halo canon. I don''t think these changes added very much since the book was already impressive as is. If you want an excellent piece of popcorn military fiction then you could do much worse than this book as well as the subsequent two volumes in the trilogy.', '2019-03-11 12:26:14.930797');

I think this is the first thing I''ve read by Nylund, but I have to say it won''t be the last. His pacing is great, the world building remarkable, but it''s the story of Master Chief becoming Master Chief, and how the SPARTAN program began with Dr. Halsey that really captured me.John-117 and the original Spartans were not volunteers; they were scouted out and taken as children, told they were being drafted, and could never return home again. Essentially, they were propagandized and brainwashed to obey orders without question. Then came the really appalling medical treatments that ended up killing or maiming seventy of the original draftees.Up to this point UNSC was not engaged with the Covenant, but the Spartans were going to be created to battle insurgencies, uprisings, piracy, and the like. To me, this makes Dr. Halsey pretty immoral as the program was extreme and these were children they were putting through.That said, when the Covenant did show up and start glassing human worlds, the Spartan program would have been completely justified. From the first attack about twenty years pass and John-117 and the other Spartans have proven their worth and are already mythical.The Spartans were sent to Sigma Ocanus IV due to the build up of Covenant forces and the fact that they hadn''t left. A large Marine contingent was sent to defend the planet, but were almost totally wiped out. John-117 sent them off with the Pelican as he and the others set out on their mission to nose around and find out what they were looking for.During their mission they record video of a new species which is standing orders, and discover that the Covenant is massed inside a Natural History Museum. In the sewers they find a way inside, tripping a motion sensor, and a squad of Jackals came in and the Spartans mopped them up. They follow some massive bloody footprints to another room, discovering another new species, Hunters. The Hunters were protecting a  rock that was being scanned and sent to space. With a lot of effort they take out the Hunters collect the rock, and destroy the device sending the signal to space.As the other squads check in, they determine there''s human presence left in the city, and following orders, they nuke it, destroying all of the Covenant forces. During an interrogation by ONI about the mission, they were peeved that he destroyed the city and what more the Covenant might have been interested in, thus more intelligence about the Covenant. John fired back that his orders were very specific and that they came out of ONI. That peeved them even more.The rock they collected contained lots of different symbols, none of which they understood. As Reach was falling, Cortana – who only recently met, and chose John – had those symbols running and John mentioned he''d seen similar images on a Covenant ship. She quickly deduces the symbols are constellations and she plotted a course though slipspace, bringing The Pillar of Autumn to HALO.If the quality of this series is as good as this book, then it will be a massively fun read.

There''s also the stories of a human traitor, a poor Grunt who just wants to survive, and an Elite determined to avenge himself on the Master Chief despite being just another enemy to him.I don''t quite like this book as much as the Eric Nylund novels in the trilogy but it''s still damned entertaining and we also get some insights into how the "regular" people reacted to the events of Halo.

Dietz does an excellent job in this area. IT takes the story telling in a whole new direction and doesn''t just give you the view from Master Chiefs visor. I for one enjoyed this story. Of course the parts with the Chief in it are fun, but the constant and fast action makes it hard to focus on the Chiefs character itself. My favorite is when the narration is from the perspectives of the other characters. It''s very refreshing and fills in the gaps of the games story that weren''t included. 4 stars.', '2019-03-11 12:26:14.930797');

I read this based on the review that said the book describes events taking place that didn''t involve the Chief in Halo: CE.  That was true for about the first half of the book.  There were some exciting large-scale battles between the UNSC marines and the Covenant, but the majority of the fighting done by the Chief was largely a recap of the FPS.  If I had a dollar for every grenade Dietz described or every time I read the Chief spun and retreated, I''d make my truck payment for the month.  The details of the battle were beyond overdone.  I ended up skipping every paragraph that started off with a statement about a grenade, assault rifle, or finding more enemies.  I do have to give Dietz credit for coming up with so many ways to describe shooting a rifle, throwing a grenade, or any other action you''d otherwise take for granted pulling the trigger on your Xbox controller.I enjoyed the look into how the Covenant military operates.  There were brief narratives about how their ships were designed.  The story of Yayap broke my general understanding that grunts were stupid pawns.  He was actually quite cunning, but knew his place given to him by the elites.Dietz has a poor reputation from my perspective in sci-fi novels.  I also read Mass Effect novels.

Playing through the game gives you a story line seen mostly through they eyes of Master Chief and his AI Cortana. I would always wonder what else was going on when I played the game. The book allows you to see everything from multiple characters, even the Covenant. Details that in my opinion, bring the story together perfectly. There is an abundance of fighting which seems somewhat redundant,but you have to remember, it''s Halo. There are so many other side stories that fill in the gaps for people who play the games. It''s pretty cool to be reading the book and trace you own steps and experiences that you had in the game. You can literally picture every turn and remember the enemies and the situation at that time. I certainly makes the book very enjoyable. I did notice that the enemies in this book seemed inconsistent with the enemies from The Fall of Reach as far as how tough they were.

With Halo: The Flood I had the opposite problem. The novel follows the plot of the video game Halo: Combat Evolved almost exactly. The parts that invovle the hero, the Master Chief, rarely deviate from the video game and some of the scenes are word for word transcripts of scenes in the game. Ironically, the action scenes are some of the most boring; the Master Chief enters a room, kills all the aliens, and then moves onto the next for a repeat. There are two sub-plots that add a little variety, one involving the marines and one that follows one of the aliens, but since they did not appear in the game they do little to advance the plot. Excluding the Chief, the characters tend to be bland and uninteresting, reducing any emotional attachment I had for them. In other words, I didn''t care how they ended up.However, I still stayed up late finishing the novel. Like the game, the book really picks up near the end and even though I already knew what was going to happen, I still found myself worrying over the Chief''s fate. The Master Chief is still an awesome character, regardless of the medium in which he is presented and that alone is reason enoughto read this book.

INSERT INTO public."Reviews" (user_id, book_id, rating, review, date_created) VALUES (2383, 663, 3, '"Halo: Cryptum" is a tough book to read, and an even harder book to review. The first in a trilogy, set hundreds of thousands of years before the events of the original "Halo" video game, "Cryptum" digs DEEP into the lore of the Forerunners, the Flood, and the origin of the Halo rings...and it does all of that without ever once even coming close to holding the reader''s hand.For my money, that''s both a good thing and a bad thing. It''s a good thing, because writer Greg Bear clearly trusts that his readers are smart enough to keep up with the LITANY of made-up vernacular – seriously, this book comes with an entire glossary of terms, just in case you forget what ‘ancilla'' or ‘Mantle'' or ‘metarch'' or ‘gea'' means and need to check – and murky Forerunner politicking that he packs into these 352 pages. It''s refreshing to read a book that doesn''t speak down to the reader or overexplain plot points that don''t need belabored. What''s more, reading a "Halo" story that''s set outside of the confines of the Human-Covenant War, in a time frame that''s yet to be truly explored and fleshed out, is beyond refreshing – it''s exhilarating, kind of in the same way that it was when George Lucas opened the floodgates to the Prequel Trilogy era. Getting to witness firsthand things that, up until now, had been only mentioned in vague asides is a real treat...at least, most of the time.And that''s where my issues with "Cryptum" begin to crop up. As mentioned, this is the first book of a trilogy, and boy, does it feel like it. In my humble opinion, the best "number ones" in trilogies do two things: they clearly and excitingly set the stage for the events yet to come in Parts 2 and 3, while also telling a compelling story on its own terms. If I were grading Cryptum on how well it does both things, I''d probably say that it puts forward a B/B+ effort with the former, and a C/C+ for the latter. It''s amazing - for a book that''s so dense and at times indecipherable, "Cryptum" often feels shockingly meandering and even – dare I say it - emptyI think part of the problem is that we''re given zero characters to connect with here – our protagonist, Bornstellar – whose perspective we view the entire story through - is basically an empty cypher, one who is nearly impossible to relate to; meanwhile, all of the supporting characters are either clichés or similarly unreadable. It also doesn''t help that the entirety of the novel''s plot – without spoiling anything – ends up, by the third, being completely tangential to the REAL plot that''s clearly going to be dominating Books 2 and 3. Don''t get me wrong, I''m psyched to read them and see what happens next...but it would have been really nice if this book felt less like a novel-length prelude to the real story and more like the first 1/3 of Bear''s epic saga. Throw in the fact that there are significant chunks of this novel that are difficult, if not nigh impossible to fully understand without consulting Halopedia, and it''s hard not to feel just a little but gipped  by the time you reach the last page.So, overall, is "Halo: Cryptum" worth a read? I''d say – just as I have with so many of these "Halo" novels and comics – that if you''re a fan of the franchise and are curious to know the backstory of this universe, then absolutely – there''s enough fun fan service, interesting revelations, and promises of a greater and better story to come to make slogging through the less enjoyable portions here worth it.

The wondrous Forerunners and their mythological legacy has always been one of the most fascinating and mysterious aspects of Halo. Up until now, the most we really got in terms of explaining what exactly happened to them was in the games'' stories (the details of which were cryptic and mysterious at best), and in the form of obscure (but cool nonetheless) terminals in the games that added some detail to their demise. This book, Cryptum, is the first of a trilogy meant to finally explain what happened 100 millennia ago that lead to their disappearance. Great idea!The book is written from the perspective of a young and rebellious Manipular (think Forerunner teenager) named Bornstellar Makes Eternal Lasting, who runs off to search for ancient artifacts from an even MORE ancient, powerful, and seemingly extinct race, the Precursors. Along with some human companions he has made the journey, they uncover and awaken a powerful, legendary Promethean (think super powerful Forerunner warrior) general named the Didact (recognize that name from the terminals of Halo 3 and Halo Anniversary?) who has spent the last thousand years in exile-by-slumber in a Cryptum. Needless to say, times are pretty tough for the Forerunners, who are now rumored to be struggling against the hideous flood in their border worlds. How fortunate, that they would find this legendary general at such a time! It''s the start of a compelling and exciting journey, to be sure. This is merely a glimpse of the premise of the story, and obviously the book has many more interesting details to uncover.Greg Bear is a fairly famous science fiction writer with a rather impressive resume and pedigree. It''s easy to see why he has this reputation when reading Cryptum. His diction is undeniably compelling and elegant, and the flow of his writing has a major feeling of eloquence to it. Bear''s writings from Bornstellar''s perspective perfectly reflects the kind of elegance and higher-thinking you''d expect of the brilliantly advanced and enlightened Forerunners, as well as the kind of arrogance you may expect of a teen (but he grows up quite a bit throughout the story in ways both conventional and not). The story itself is fairly compelling and fast moving. It was very easy to just keep reading and reading and reading, 100 pages flash by in what seems like a few minutes. It''s super engrossing. The characters are, for the most part, well written and the story surrounding them progresses quite naturally. It''s very compelling.Bear''s intriguing word choice and flow also complements the overall Forerunner culture. Even after reading this book, the Forerunners still feel mysterious and details of their existence are still quite open to interpretation and speculation. Even the physical description they are given leaves some room for interpretation, and their technology still feels like magic. How does their personal armor/suits allow them to go without sleeping? How does it extend the lifespan so many thousands of years? Writing from the perspective of a Forerunner is pretty clever, as he describes the technology like it''s common and the inner-workings and functions of it all is already understood, so no attempt to explain that stuff is made. So while we may read that a ship that assembled itself from a mechanical seed activating under a mountain, converting said mountain into raw materials and then into a massive monolith of a ship, we have no clue how it does so, keeping the sense of mystery and wonder at the Forerunners'' ingenuity intact. Great job with that!The only complaint I would make about this book is that, at times, it feels as if Bear was instructed not to say *too* much with regards to important details. This trilogy is being coordinated by 343 Industries, the company in charge of Halo''s development, and as  such, they have a large degree of control over what details go into each book. They have expressed that this trilogy of books will majorly resonate with the upcoming Halo 4 and the rest of the new Reclaimer Trilogy. Because of this, the book sometimes feels like major details are kept hush-hush and skimped over, and more minute, inconsequential details are fluffed up and stretched out more to fill-out the book, all in the name of keeping Halo 4''s surprises, well, surprising. In fact, some "big moments" are so small in comparison to the build-ups of them, you''ll be left wondering, "Wait, what just happened? Did I miss something?" As such, there are times when this book feels a bit like a tease, a dangling carrot on a stick that doesn''t quite get the pay-offs or explanations you''d hope for after all the build up in the book. Again, I understand the information and details have to be rationed out because of 343i''s agenda. Even so, these complaints are pretty small in comparison to the strengths of the book. Don''t let it dissuade you from picking Cryptum up. It is, after all, the first in a trilogy and the future installments will undoubtedly answer questions this book doesn''t.Overall, this is a definitely solid start to a great idea for a Halo book trilogy. A lot of details that have been revealed in this book may upset a lot of people who thought they figured everything out about the Forerunner history. I was kind of shocked at some of the details this book revealed about not only Forerunner history, but also the history of ancient Humans, San ''Shyuum (also known as the "prophets" of the covenant), and the flood. Despite the "carrot on a stickery" at times, this book has *a lot* of relevatory details to enjoy. As one who loves the Halo series mostly for its awesome story, this is a fairly easy recommendation. Just don''t go in with preconceived notions of what the story should be, and you''ll be much rewarded with a well-written, fascinating look at the beginning of the end for the Forerunners.', '2019-03-11 12:26:14.930797');

I came in expecting it to be the darker middle entry in a trilogy that would ultimately have a tragic-but-hopeful ending. This book is not that. It is dark to be sure, but in many ways, this hardly feels in any way like a sequel to Cryptum. The only thing that even reminds me that this is related to that book is that some characters reappear, and that it takes place on a Halo, but that''s about it. That''s not necessarily a bad thing, but there''s no doubt this book suffers a bit more than the first, despite its strengths.This book takes place starting at an event roughly two-thirds of the way through Cryptum, when everyone has been captured by the Master Builder. Somehow, Chakas and Riser have been misplaced in a chaotic situation and end up on a rogue Halo installation, now under the control of the mysterious Primordial and the rampant AI Mendicant Bias. The story is told through Chakas'' viewpoint, and chronicles his journey alongside companions new and old across the surface of this great ringworld, in excruciating detail. It''s a VERY interesting story and quite compelling at times. There are tons of genuinely fascinating concepts, ideas, events, and characters dotting the landscape of this story. The actual events and revelations are truly great and some are even moving. It''s not perfect though. Characters'' moods and emotions will sometimes change on a dime for seemingly no reason, and it feels at times like there''s little genuine character development, which is a shame after Cryptum did such a good job at that.Much like Cryptum, Bear really captures the essence of the main character, and his viewpoint of the world becomes our own in the story. Because of that though, I find that the story in Primordium has almost no structure. The perspective is firmly focused on Chakas, what happens to him, and what he thinks about everything happening, but the narrative of the book never has any structure that really tells you what is happening in the overall "Forerunner Trilogy" big picture. You have to figure it out yourself in many parts. The characters have no destination in mind, are confused for most of the book as to what to do or where to go, and trust me, you''ll share those feelings of confusion and uncertainty. I''m not sure if that was a purposeful narrative decision by Greg Bear, and I''m also not certain of whether or not it''s a good thing. When you add in the ancestral imprints by the Librarian, who are practically characters unto themselves, and you''ve got another layer of complication. Another side-effect of seeing the world through Chakas'' eyes is that, because pretty much everything outside of Earth is foreign and mysterious to Chakas, descriptions of almost everything are really confusing and nonsensical. Bornstellar at least understood what Forerunner tech was and how it worked and so did we as readers, even if we didn''t understand all of its inner-workings, we at could at least understand what function it had and what it did. Chakas has no clue as to even that, so encounters with, for example, Forerunner cities or transport trains on Halo, are confusing to even figure out how to imagine what it looks like in our minds.I find that this book suffers from the issues that Cryptum had, but much, much more so. Many of the important revelations in the story are buried and almost lost in tons and tons of exposition that focuses on minute and completely unimportant details. It''s no exaggeration to say that for every page of genuinely compelling development in the overall narrative, there''s anywhere from 7-10 pages of, for narrative purposes, useless information that merely extends the story''s mass. Tons of effort went into describing minute details of every landscape they came across, the smallest details of landmarks such as a tree or a structure, and things like that. Then, huge moments, such as encounters with the Primordial or Mendicant Bias, flash by in just a few pages. Thankfully, all of the exposition is still focused on fascinating things, such as the Halo''s landscape and innerworkings, as well as the countless people all inhabiting the Halo. Even if it is "fluff," it''s still pretty interesting to take in. Personally, I don''t mind more pensive, meandering novels (I loved Xenocide, which was much the same way) and so I liked most of Primordium myself despite all the "fluff." I can''t deny that this book definitely has a ton of build-ups without enough pay-off to justify it though, and sometimes the overall narrative gets buried by all the fluff. Really, all of the pivotal information could be condensed into a short-story ranging anywhere from 100-180 pages and still be good. Who knows?This book is genuinely compelling, its overall story is quite interesting if not confusing to patch together at times, and has a lot of interesting revelations at a pivotal, but small event in the Forerunner-Flood war.Personally, I found it hard to put the book down a lot of the time, but after finishing it, I recognize its flaws and some can be glaring. There''s a lot of mind-blowing revelations in this book, and some of the pay-offs, while not given nearly as much page-space as the build ups, are truly spectacular. I just find that this book is not as good as Cryptum. I understand that Bear was given strict instructions by 343 Industries about what details to include to give us tantalizing hints at what''s to come in Halo 4, but also plenty of details to exclude, so as to keep Halo 4 surprising and compelling when we finally play it. I understand that, but sometimes in the name of keeping on this strict narrative schedule, this book suffered a bit. Silentium seems poised to answer all questions that the first two books left unanswered (released a couple months after Halo 4 of course. Gotta keep that schedule. :P). It was hard for me to rate this book, but despite its problems, I enjoyed it. If you are a massive Halo fan like I am, then this is a good book to get, but it will also take some effort to get into and understand, not to mention patience to keep up with it. I hope that helps. Thank you and good day. :)', '2019-03-11 12:26:14.930797');

How exactly a Slipspace drive works? How the Covenant Engineers think? What an AI does while it''s wasting it''s time with slow human speech? It''s all explained here.A clever incorporation of humor helps an otherwise dire plot blossom into a balanced tale. There are no Spartans in this story, and this enables Mr. Staten to flesh out the lesser mortals inhabiting the planet Harvest. They are strong-willed people, aided by some fantastically depicted AIs.In fact, none of the other books have depicted AIs in such great detail. In Eric Nylund''s books, for instance, the general perception is that AIs think far faster than humans. Very little else is communicated to the reader, other than a bunch of nonsensical tasks. In Contact Harvest, however, Mr. Staten presents two AIs communicating with each other, and suddenly, time is dilated as each AIs processes are described in vivid detail.Again, the benefit of having a game designer pen a novel is that they are aware of the emotions that course through the gamer''s veins as their game unveils itself. Now, they can take all these characters, situations and emotions, and extrapolate back through time to produce a prequel novel like Contact Harvest.I''d give this book a 4.5/5, with the 0.5 knocked off for the overly descriptive passages that could turn non-fanatics off.

The setting is a book, comic, and video game series featuring military characters doing battle with an alien theocracy known as the Covenant. The Kilo-5 novels, which starts with Glasslands, chronicles the events following Halo 3 when the Master Chief has disappeared, the Covenant has been defeated, and an uneasy peace exists between humanity with the various former Covenant races.  The premise is the Office of Naval Intelligence (ONI) has decided to start arming insurgent alien religious groups with weapons to rise up against the strongest remaining Covenant state. Admiral Parangosky, leader of ONI, believes this is the only way to guarantee humanity''s survival against future aggression despite the current leadership being friendly with humanity. Given the author Karen Traviss'' familiarity with real-life blowback from doing the same with the future Taliban during the Soviet-Afghanistan War, I can only assume the foolishness of this action was deliberate.  Meanwhile, Doctor Catherine Halsey is marooned with a group of Spartans on a Forerunner shield-world, unaware of the events of Halo 3. Doctor Halsey is attempting to make up for her crimes in creating the original Spartans by protecting them from the destruction of the galaxy at the hands of the Flood. Not knowing this has been prevented, the group slowly begins turning against her as Chief Mendez vents his decades of guilt over the same project she''s trying to atone for. It gets worse for Doctor Halsey as Captain Serin Osman, a Spartan-II program "washout", plots revenge against her for the kidnapping and body-horror she endured.  As these events go on, Sangheili (one of the Covenant races) Jul''mdama has grown to hate and loathe humanity. Refusing to believe his current government''s path is the right one, he chooses to ally with the very same religious fanatics currently being armed by ONI. It''s a twisted collection of plots, subplots, and counter-plots which all come together in a prequel for the events of Halo 4.  What''s interesting is all of this is built on the organic foundation of Halo''s politics and faction rather than anything typical of video game sci-fi like ancient artifacts or some dastardly villain setting plans in motion. It all flows from the fact, post-Halo 3, just about everyone working together to defeat the Prophet of Truth and Flood still hated each other.  I''ve been a big fan of Karen Traviss and her writing since her days writing for the Star Wars Expanded Universe. I loved her Republic Commando books and even had a neat little pen-pal relationship with her on RPG.net for a short while. I even sent her a package of my books back when I was a very-very crappy writer. Hehe. While I didn''t always agree with her portrayal of characters in those books, I''ve rarely met an author who was nicer to her fans. I also felt she was a great fit for the Haloverse as she does excellent military science-fiction depictions.  The Kilo-5 team is an interesting collection of individuals and I have to say I enjoyed spending time with them. I enjoyed how they''re able to wrap themselves in the comforting warmth of patriotism and doing what was necessary even as the narrative makes it clear they''re somewhat deluding themselves. As we see in Halo 4, their actions will have terrible consequences for humanity but they trust their superiors to know what they''re doing even as the book slowly unravels that trust.  I was particularly fond of Spartan-II Naomi who came off as an adorable cutie despite being raised as a supersoldier. I also enjoyed the character of Black Box as the A.I. vacillated between ruthlessly manipulative and supportive. Captain Osman is also a somewhat tragic character as she has allied herself with ONI out of misguided rage and personal loyalty but the consequences of such may well be her becoming the same sort of person who created her tragedy in the first plans.  Some fans may have difficulty with the treatment of fan favorite Doctor Halsey who is called out repeatedly for her kidnapping of children to create the Spartans. I believe Karen Traviss is aware of just how hypocritical Chief Mendez and Admiral Parangosky are being, though, attempting to project guilt from their own sins on her.  Indeed, Doctor Halsey says Mendez''s remorse is an illusion since he repeated the crime without her a decade later. Much of the book depends on irony and self-justification which is something which fits into spy fiction as we see everyone attempting to play off their shady deals as the right thing to do, no matter how dishonorable or brutal those actions may be. The other guy is always bad and thus anything done to them is justified.  I especially liked that we got into Doctor Halsey''s head about the fact she''s just lost her daughter, Miranda Keyes, and that she doesn''t have any beliefs or remaining loved ones to provide her comfort during this time. The fact the UNSC is turning on her during this just makes it a double gut-punch. Doctor Halsey may have done some awful things but she was a humanized character and the engine which enabled her actions moves on without her. Some of the writing is overwrought with Doctor Halsey talking about being a soulless being but I can''t help but assume she''s confronting her own guilt.  This is a entertaining military science fiction novel but sometimes goes a bit overboard in depicting its characters reactions. I think they''d be a bit more subdued personally with their self-righteousness given the moral ambiguities of their work but, despite this, I think it was really entertaining and encourage Halo fans to pick up the trilogy before playing Halo 4.9/10', '2019-03-11 12:26:14.930797');
INSERT INTO public."Reviews" (user_id, book_id, rating, review, date_created) VALUES (2423, 677, 1, 'I purchased this book despite the bad reviews. I was hoping it was a case where I would enjoy it even if others haven''t. Honestly, it is the worst Halo novel I''ve read. I own and love all the Halo novels before this one including the Forerunner Saga. However, Karen Traviss took what we had known about the characters from the previous novels and completely threw it away. I''m not sure how people can actually like this book, because of this fact.Others have written about the flaws of this book, but here are a few points I have to get off my chest.[Spoilers]Halsey is basically the devil incarnate in this novel series. I understand Halsey did morally outrageous acts. However, she is made with such a lack of dimension in this book; she comes across as a comic book villain. Nothing is really said about the fact that she did actually care about her Spartan-IIs. To an extent at which someone like her could. In real life extremely smart people often have problems relating to others, especially those with less intelligence. I, for instance, am not extremely intelligent, but smart enough that when I see people doing stupid things all around me it gets on my nerves. So, I can almost relate. I just take my annoyances and multiply them, a lot.Even Chief Mendez turns on Halsey. When Halsey fires back about the Spartan-IIIs, he defends himself by saying they were volunteers and that basically wins the argument. Nothing is said about how the Spartan-IIIs were created for suicide missions and that they were culled from orphans. Also the fact that they were very young, which means even if the "volunteered" they were still just children, Another fact is that the augmentations for Spartan-IIs wouldn''t have worked well with ordinary people, that is why they chose the people with the best genes. It was only later that the procedures were improved which lead to higher success rates and they probably wouldn''t have been able to improve them if Halsey hadn''t created the Spartan-IIs in the first place. Finally, the Spartan-IIIs were given increased aggression that could interfere with rational though if not kept in check, Mendez was an intelligent soldier. He maybe haunted by his actions, but based on the previous novels I believe that he would have known he had no moral high ground to stand on. If he had even been moved to blame Halsey anyway. However, Traviss apparently decided that these points were unimportant and she just needed yet another character to bash Halsey with.I liked Lucy in Ghosts of Onyx, but in this story she became yet another victim of the idea that everyone must hate Halsey. She ends up punching Halsey and freeing herself of her psychological muteness, because Halsey was badgering an Engineer? How does this make sense? I doubt Halsey would have be so abrasive with it. Sure she can be abrasive, but the scenario just felt like it was written just so Lucy would attack her. As I was reading it I remember thinking, Halsey wouldn''t be acting like this and Lucy probably wouldn''t be getting so angry either.I don''t know how anyone can actually care about Kilo-Five. The ODSTs came off as idiots. Osman is a washed out Spartan-II who has been brainwashed by Parangosky, who is nothing better than a personal enemy of Halsey. In fact, she new everything about the Spartan-II project, because it was an ONI project. She also has no moral high ground, but is quick to dispense judgement. Osman is the same, because she was trained by Parangosky to hate Halsey, even though Kilo-Five''s entire mission is a deplorable atrocity. Instead of helping their number one supporter Thel ''Vadam, they help his opponents. Apparently, they want the Elites to remain in chaos, but they basically enable the anti-humanist faction and maybe even instigated the next war between Humans and Elites. I doubt Jul ''Mdama would have been able to come to power over the Elite splinter factions and cause so much chaos later.Traviss doesn''t seem to know the definition of Top Secret, Classified information, or need to know basis. She has Osman tell the ODSTs everything about the Spartan-II program. Well, almost everything, since it is all a manipulation on Traviss'' part to make the characters hate Halsey. The ODSTs did not need to know about any of it to accomplish they mission. I don''t care if Osman wanted to create a bond with her team or some such thing, that wouldn''t have happened. That''s all I have to say about that.Traviss'' seems to grasp the concept of black ops enough to try to write a book about a black ops team. However, a key point bought up to make Halsey look even more devious was the flash cloning of the Spartan-II children. Supposedly, Halsey authorized this herself without permission, which is doubtful to begin with. Somehow, this was an unnecessary evil, because the parents thought their kids had died when the clone deteriorated. It was a calculated maneuver, not some personal whim Halsey tacked on to her highly detailed, Top Secret program. By making clones, there isn''t going to be 75 missing children investigations. If someone manages to see a Spartan-II and recognize them as the child, they are more likely to dismiss them as just looking similar, because they "know" that child is dead. These are just two very good reasons for the flash clones. THe book indicates one person suspecting the flash clone not being his child. That is better than seventy-five entire families looking for their loved ones. Frankly, I view Parangosky as an idiot if she is head of the most secretive department in human civilization and not realizing this.Traviss even has Parangosky rub in the fact to Halsey that Colonel Ackerson died a hero. I''m glad he did something redeemable. However, he tried to kill John-117 and Cortana in the training ground just to prove Halsey wrong. Also, he started the suicidal Spartan-III program largely as Halsey''s rival. He had few redeeming qualities, but of course Traviss tries to make him look better than Halsey.Halsey did some very terrible actions, but she did them because many people thought there was going to be a massive war between Humans. She was authorized by ONI. She made smart, calculated, if cold decisions. However she is far from Mengele, as Traviss heavily tried to point out. Mengele did experiments because he could and didn''t care if they succeeded or the patients survived as long as he got information from them. He wanted to further the German race as he viewed it. Halsey had a purpose for her experiments and tried to make sure they were successful with minimum casualties and she thought she was furthering the entire Human race. Considering this idea of augmenting Humans was still in it''s infancy, she did rather well and paved the way for Spartan-IIIs, Spartan-IVs, and perhaps eventually all of humanity.[End Spoilers]Karen Traviss does manage to get details right, but she glosses over them if they don''t fit here overall scheme. So this book was a huge disappointment. I was looking forward to seeing the post war galaxy, but it was drowned out by Traviss'' own agenda, blatant disregard of previous character''s personalities, and dislike of certain characters.', '2019-03-11 12:26:14.930797');

That''s my personal opinion however, I could be wrong, I personally liked having the Elites on our side at the end of Halo 3 and would want to keep helping them afterwards. However this isn''t a Halo 3 review so let me keep this about the book.I got excited when the book started to go into the story of the other Spartans and looked forward to some action going on that I''m used to seeing when there are the UNSC''s greatest troops involved. However for the majority of the book they are pretty much used as bodyguards and are just there for show, telling the crew about their past. I don''t agree with this. This book brings out too many emotions that is just completely out of character for the Spartans. I dont expect everyone or even hardly anyone to agree with the way the Dr. Halsey created the Spartans before the war started but hey, she did it and that fact turned the tide of the Covenant War to our favor and that fact alone.

However, I was wrong and a little let down. The book mainly focuses on ONI and it''s straight plotting against our now allies and I dont agree with that. This is supposed to be an action saga and the fact that it has been brought down to dirty tricks and knives in the back, it just kinda sucks. This isn''t going to keep me from reading the next book however, I hear it is an improvement and look forward to things getting better in the Halo universe.', '2019-03-11 12:26:14.930797');

I feel bad giving this a poor review. I know writing is not easy, I have tried many times but after enjoying the other Halo books so much I was extremely disappointed reading this.First off, the character''s monologues (mainly Halsey''s) are so painful to read, it reminds me of something you''d find in some over emotional, slightly paranoid teenager''s journal entries. Some of the writing confused me at times,  take for example this oddity written when a spartan and ODST try to awkwardly communicate."Everyone in uniform griped all the time. It was one of those fundamental things that bonded ships and armies. When the griping stopped, officers worried." Oh so every UNSC soldier just needs to gripe and moan as much as Dr.Halsey does about everything and morale will be through the roof! C''mon, these are tough as nails, highly trained soldiers, they bond through thrills and kills not freaking gossiping.There are also way too many stories going on at one time and none of them feel fleshed out. The only character that I felt got the most treatment was Dr. Halsey, and it wasn''t good. Halsey goes from a motherly-genius-professional to a whiny-emo-hopeless-wreck. Traviss  does this overly-used-odd-description-thing-with-dashes that was getting old a quarter of the way through the book.Now, Karen Travis''s isn''t a terrible writer, but I feel that her style is not fit for the Halo franchise.

This volume deals with the birth and early years of Pierre de Siorac, the protagonist. The Brethren of the title are Jean de Siorac, Pierre''s father, and Jean de Sauveterre, two Huguenot soldiers who become bosom friends and decide to treat each other as brothers. The book narrates the ascent of The Brethren, as they buy land and become part of the aristocracy of the Périgord region in France. Against a background of wars with the English and the Spaniards, of civil and sectarian conflicts, of plague and famine, Merle tells a wonderful story of a tightly knit household (besides The Brethren and the children of de Siorac by multiple women it includes various household servants and retainers) enduring prospering. By the end Pierre leaves the family castle to study medicine in Montpellier, accompanied by his half-brother and a servant who is also a close friend. He has loved his father and honored his mother (this dual duty generates much conflict), has known love, sex and loss and is impelled forward by the irresistible high spirits of youth and health.

The author''s use of the "Book of Reason" as a way of conveying information across generations, as well as sharing emotions and words that cannot be said, was a very clever device that fit brilliantly within the story.  Delightfully lovable characters adds to the story''s charm.

It is packed with impressive detail about the Wars of Religion that wracked France for more than a generation during the 16th century.  Details of the appalling conduct of both faiths is unstintingly illumined and a bright light is shone on the hypocrisy of both faiths.The title refers to two soldiers who serve together for nearly a decade, during which they become devoted to both the new faith and each other.  Upon discharge they pool their resources and abilities to purchase and improve a chateau in the Perigord region of France.  With a Protestant ethic that would make the Puritans look like slackers, they prosper mightily and achieve unimagined success with one ennobled as a baron.  It is though no surety of success and there are keen observations on the part of the author noting how elusive both happiness and security can be.By framing the novel around religion, Merle opens up the lens through which we usually view history.  The struggles of kings, nobility and generals is invariably about power.  That is an aspect of the story.  But the infusion of faith raises other topics.  Ethical quandaries abound: do they force their servants to practice their faith as the monarchy forced Catholicism upon them? Is the murder of fellow Protestants invitation to respond in kind? Does God really intend for the strong and the powerful to become richer still with every famine, at the expense of neighbors of lower rank and resources?  What allegiance do I own my faith v. my country?Two protagonists, who the reader can generally admire (despite their dour and mercenary qualities) are a multitude of contradictions.  The marriage of one to a Catholic is a believable duel of wills; their children, servants and retainers an interesting and believable lot.  It is this look at the landed gentry, burghers and serving class, plausible and replete with details I found really refreshing.  Ironically, this realism or authenticity in some ways works against the characters in the novel.  Siorac and Sauvterre and their Protestant cohorts are both victims and victimizers.  It is a story without heroes.  Undoubtedly it''s an authentic view of the past.

What a great, super fast chile! The canned pinto beans come out as perfectly cooked as if they were made from dried beans - still firm on the outside but deliciously creamy on the inside. I will say that, after having made it twice already, the type of salsa you use is key to this dish. Thicker salsa makes thicker chile and thinner makes a chile with a more liquid broth. I happened to have a jar of Guy Fieri''s Salsa Verde in my fridge and although I''m not that crazy about it as straight up salsa, it really gave this chile some great body - more so than when I made it with the more standard salsa verde from Trader Joe''s. Instead of cilantro and shredded cheese, I had sour cream and shredded cheese as toppings and everyone fell in love with this recipe.-- Irish Beef and Root Vegetable Stew. Another really good dish, made Irish by the addition of a cup of Guinness Stout. I mean, really, what could go wrong?
