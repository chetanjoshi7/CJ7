And if you''re in college, hoping for a job in computing when you graduate, this book is for you too.  It''s an anarchic compendium  of the anarchic vocabulary, habits, and style of the programming  profession.The New Hacker''s Dictionary is mostly arranged as a set of  alphabetical entries, but there are a couple of excellent appendices, on  hacker folklore and on the hacker lifestyle and habits.  (Hacker is used  here in its original sense of someone who enjoys and is good at  programming--Raymond has included both "hacker" and  "cracker" as entries, of course.)  The entry on folklore is  simply hilarious; I wish I could just include Guy Steele''s "more  magic" story here, but I''ll just have to tell you to buy the  book.The entries are a real mixture.  Many, such as "indent  style", go beyond just defining the term: this entry gives examples of  the four major C styles and mentions the holy wars (another entry . . .)  which have occurred over them.  Some are quite current: Easter egg, kluge,  Trojan horse; others are arcane or dated, but still interesting: NeWS,  CP/M, chiclet keyboard.  All the entries are interesting and  well-written.Newcomers to the field may find a good deal of  enlightenment here, and old-timers will find a lot of memories.  My own  favourite entries relate to the old text-based game Adventure, which I  encountered on a CDC machine in 1981.  "I see no <X> here."  "Plugh!"  "Xyzzy!"  *Sigh*  It almost makes me miss  those old teletypes.');
INSERT INTO public."Reviews" (review_id, user_id, book_id, rating, review) VALUES (2418, 1800, 33, 4, 'Perhaps we should start by telling what this dictionary isn''t. First, it has nothing to do with breaking into computer systems and similar illegal activities which any layman would usually associate with hackers. It teaches you that hacking is not the correct name for breaking into computers, though. Second, it is not a dictionary of IT terminology. You can probably do your IT job quite well without knowing what a foobar is. And third, it is not a dictionary of the current cyber slang. The main reason for this is probably the fact that Eric Raymond is well beyond his teenage years.Altogether, I don''t even think The New Hacker''s Dictionary fits the category of a reference work. Instead I''d dare to call it literature in the form of a dictionary, much like the classical Devil''s Dictionary by Ambrose Bierce, or The Meaning of Liff by Douglas Adams. Sure, many entries can be used as reference, although a lot of them actually refer to historic software and hardware items like ITS, PDP-10 or LISP machines. The New Hacker''s Dictionary not the dry, encyclopedic style of dictionary - entries are written in an opinionated, juicy style. The humorous side of the dictionary - a work of a witty, creative hacker mind picking names for things - certainly vastly outweighs its practical side.So is this book for you? Yes, if the legendary MIT AI lab hacker scene fascinates you. Although LISP machines are gone, it''s perhaps still affecting your computing environment more than you think. For example: Linux, the free Unix clone, is built on top of the GNU project, which descends directly from the MIT AI lab hacker scene. And finally, is there any point in buying a printed book, if the complete text is available on Raymond''s web site so you can read it on-line?  I''d say it is. You see, it''s not particularly convenient to take your computer into the bath tub.');

Hackers are unjustly maligned by the media as being evil types who just want to wreak havoc on big business and government computer systems, when in reality they view breaking in on security systems as a hobby and almost always alert the authorities to the system break-in.This dictionary of hacker terms (which can be hilarious, informative, or esoteric depending on their meaning) gives an idea of the creativity and mentality of the hackers and their distrust of huge corporations (ie "Broken Windows" for Sun''s "Open Windows," "Windoze" for Microsoft Windows, and so on). Reading though the definition of terms gives you an idea of how to "talk turkey" with said hackers, and even if I will always be just a "wannabe" hacker, it helps to be able to get an idea of the mindset of the hacker.At the back of the book, there''s even a brief compilation of hacker "folklore" and "legends," a portrait of a "typical hacker," and ways to help the hacker culture grow (like getting a free Unix system or contributing to organizations like the Free Software Foundation).Books like this one, The Cathedral and the Bazaar, and Open Sources give an excellent view of the hacker culture.');

You get every single one of his dialogues and even quite a few that probably aren''t by him just for good measure.Not only does the content justify the higher price, but also the quality of the book itself. The sewn binding ensures years of use, and the red cloth under the dust jacket looks lovely. The paper is excellent and smooth; the copyright page reads, "The paper used in this publication meets the minimum requirements of American National Standard for Informational Sciences-Permenance of Paper for printed library materials."I can''t think of any reason to buy a smaller volume with only a few dialogues in it - if you love Plato, you will want to read all his works eventually, and this volume can serve you well and last a lifetime.');

I''m sure if I had studied Russia or Russian literature those parts would have been very interesting. Most of it seems to be social commentary on the ideals of the time...and farming...lots and lots of farming! These sections slowed the book down for me and that''s why it''s four stars and not five. Although I am working with a limited IQ quite frankly, and so this assessment is more a failing on my own part, and not that of the book.I did enjoy it very much. It has a lot to say about women and their place in society and how double standards applied to Anna but not to Vronsky because of what they''d done. Something that we can still relate to somewhat today. Women are typically shamed for their sexual behavior where as men are not. Tolstoy showed this beautifully and I really felt for Anna.');

The characters are emotional, the historical element is intriguing and the setting of Russia in her glory days all combine to make this one of the best classical novels (in my opinion).

I thought that the previous two books were excellent, but this final one blew away my expectations. It was a tremendously engaging read--like many people I often use the phrase "couldn''t put it down", but this time it was true. Karen Traviss created an incredibly human, believable, compelling ensemble of characters for the trilogy and she outdid herself with her writing this time. Even the artificial intelligence she wrote, Black-Box, comes across as more human and relatable than the protagonists of many other bestselling novels I''ve read, and I dare say some of the people that I actually know.While the past Halo books were fun expansions of the games'' universe with bits of history, world-building, and action, this trilogy--and especially Mortal Dictata--went far deeper than that. Mortal Dictata is a beautiful, deep exploration of morality, justice, and what it means to be human, at a level that I never expected out of the Halo novels (and I say that as an avid reader and fan of them) and it has earned a position as one of my three favourite books. It gives us a look at the minds of people who have done great things and terrible things to ensure the survival of the human race through a brutal war, and brings us along for the ride as they deal with the consequences of those actions.If you need a reason to read this book, it is this: Mortal Dictata asks us how far is too far to go when extinction is a real and immediate threat; if it being a novel based on a game series makes you think it won''t make you question not only your views on the subject, but the very notion of there being a right answer, I assure you that it will when it shows you--side by side and in vivid, living colour--the benefits and the human costs of actions taken for the greater good.');

I''m glad I read it (and re-read it in anticipation for the Scorch Trials movie - after seeing the trailer and not remembering anything that happens there, happening in the book)... however it doesn''t stick out from every other post-apocalyptical series. There weren''t any shocking moments right up until the epilogue of the third book (Death Cure) but that was more of an "Oh S**T... actually... well, that doesn''t surprise me".

The prequel doesn''t interest me as it only sums up what happened before the tale of Thomas and the Gladers and features all new characters. No thanks.The first book in the series is the soon-to-be-in-theatres, movie adapted version of the book, The Maze Runner.Synopsis from Goodreads:"If you ain''t scared, you ain''t human."When Thomas wakes up in the lift, the only thing he can remember is his name. He''s surrounded by strangers--boys whose memories are also gone.Outside the towering stone walls that surround the Glade is a limitless, ever-changing maze. It''s the only way out--and no one''s ever made it through alive.Then a girl arrives. The first girl ever. And the message she delivers is terrifying.---While reading it, I was constantly very annoyed with the flow of writing; James Dashner''s unpolished writing and repetitiveness continued to bother me throughout this book and the entire series. His writing distracted me so much that it really took away from the book. I also found the novel quite boring, yet promising, but it constantly left me waiting in anticipation and disappointing me later on. I always refer to The Maze Runner as a book that would do well as a movie; the plot is intriguing and unique and they would strip away the irrelevant things and might even make it better than the book.The Scorch Trials, the second book in the series, I found more enticing.Synopsis from Goodreads:Solving the Maze was supposed to be the end.Thomas was sure that escape from the Maze would mean freedom for him and the Gladers. But WICKED isn’t done yet. Phase Two has just begun. The Scorch.There are no rules. There is no help. You either make it or you die.The Gladers have two weeks to cross through the Scorch—the most burned-out section of the world. And WICKED has made sure to adjust the variables and stack the odds against them.Friendships will be tested. Loyalties will be broken. All bets are off.There are others now. Their survival depends on the Gladers’ destruction—and they’re determined to survive.---I had originally planned to not continue the series as The Maze Runner didn''t satisfy me enough - or at least wait until I have time to read it - but I had someone tell me that I MUST continue; that James Dashner offers so much more in the last two books. I decided to take a chance and commit to the second book. It was definitely an improvement; it seemed as if Dashner was trying to appeal to an older audience as the gore and violence would be a little too much for a pre-teen, in my opinion. Some scenes were very graphic, but that made it all the more interesting. It was a lot more intriguing and kept me reading, excited for what would happen next as their lives continued to be in impending danger. New characters were introduced, loyalties were questioned, and a new problem was brought to the Gladers'' attention, bringing them closer to the truth.Last, but not least, The Death Cure.Synopsis on Goodreads:Thomas knows that Wicked can''t be trusted, but they say the time for lies is over, that they''ve collected all they can from the Trials and now must rely on the Gladers, with full memories restored, to help them with their ultimate mission. It''s up to the Gladers to complete the blueprint for the cure to the Flare with a final voluntary test.What Wicked doesn''t know is that something''s happened that no Trial or Variable could have foreseen. Thomas has remembered far more than they think. And he knows that he can''t believe a word of what Wicked says.The time for lies is over. But the truth is more dangerous than Thomas could ever imagine.Will anyone survive the Death Cure?---The improvement from The Scorch Trials dissipated, I guess, because this book reminded me of The Maze Runner; it lacked excitement, was promising, yet disappointing, and I was disappointed, but the writing has improved at least. There''s some action within the book that will have you on your toes, but you will reel back easily without even a skipped heartbeat. There wasn''t enough intensity in the novel until, basically, the very end. Things get intense then. Other than that, it didn''t excite me enough. The characters spent a lot of time running back and forth and a character is mentioned in The Scorch Trials and in The Death Cure that only receives the light of day at the conclusion of the novel. All finales are rushed though, they can''t help it.I believe the series as a whole was...good. Just "good". It is a series worth reading and many will enjoy it, but I wouldn''t call it my favourite series. If they were each individual books and not part of a series, I''d say read the Scorch Trials, but as a whole series, I don''t know. I''d probably say something like "The Maze Runner was okay, I guess, but The Scorch Trials was really good! The Death Cure was kind of boring." Also, the series as a whole was confusing; in each book, there was a new reason for WICKED''s methods. It was just too much information, he should have just picked one.Overall, it''s a good series. I would recommend it; I''m sure many will like it, and I absolutely cannot wait to see the movies! They should be amazing! It may not be the best series, but they''re worth reading. It brings a fresh, never before seen, idea to the bookshelves. Well, I''ve never read anything like it, but I don''t know for sure if there''s absolutely nothing like it. Anyways, enjoy, try to look past his writing style and you should be fine. And what I mean by his writing style, I am mainly talking about his fragmented sentences. For example, he would write something like this: "He screamed his throat raw, called for help."....................................................................................................................yeah. He does it constantly throughout the series. If you see nothing wrong with that sentence, then you should be able to enjoy the series.');

He was Professor of Medieval and Renaissance Literature at Cambridge, where he counted J.R.R. Tolkien among his friends. "The Horse and his Boy", the third book of the Chronicles of Narnia, was first published in 1954.Although the series is known as the "Chronicles of Narnia", much of the action takes place in the neighbouring countries of Calormen and Archenland. Shasta, the boy mentioned in the book''s title, is introduced first - he''s been brought up in Calormen by a fisherman called Arsheesh. One evening, a local prince stops with the pair and demands hospitality. Later, when Shasta overhears the prince and his father bartering for Shasta himself, he decides to run away. Luckily for Shasta, the prince''s horse is a captured Narnian horse called Bree - and, as a Narnian, Bree can talk. Bree has also set his heart on escaping and returning home and agrees to take Shasta with him - recognising the boy as either a fellow Narnian or an Archenlander, rather than being native to Calormen. The pair make off together that night and, before long, they are joined on the road by another fleeing pair : Aravis and Hwin. Aravis is a Calormen princess being forced to marry against her will while Hwin, like Bree, is a captured Narnian horse. The four escapees must make their way through Calormen''s capital, Tashbaan, and then across the northern desert to safety.It''s possible I''m seeing more in this book than was intended, and I know it''s supposed to be a kid''s book - but I''d have to describe the portrayal of Calormen''s people as not only the book''s big flaw but also very questionable. Physically, they''re described as having dark faces and wear turbans, while their favoured weapon is the scimitar. As individuals, only Aravis is portrayed in anything vaguely resembling a positive light. Arsheesh, Shasta''s foster-father, had no qualms about selling him into slavery, while Aravis'' father was apparently happy to arrange her man to the Grand Vizier - someone old enough to be her grandfather. Meanwhile, the Tisroc - Calormen''s ruler - is the sort of cheap and easy villain others have tried to fabricate again more recently : he actually sneers at the concept of freedom. Narnia''s King Edmund and Queen Susan also appear briefly - Queen Lucy''s appearance is barely even fleeting. Edmund, who didn''t exactly cover himself in glory in "The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe", maintains his low standards when his refers to Prince Rabadash as Susan''s "dark faced lover". He isn''t long in adding that Rabadash is "proud, bloody, luxurious, cruel and a self-pleasing tyrant". (From only a slightly different perspective, of course, the very same thing could be said about Peter - Narnia''s High King and Edmund''s brother). All of which is a great pity, as the bones of this story are much stronger than those of "The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe".');
INSERT INTO public."Reviews" (review_id, user_id, book_id, rating, review) VALUES (2474, 1853, 71, 4, '"The Horse And His Boy" is one of CS Lewis'' classic Narnia books, one of the later published but the third if taken chronologically. The tale takes place during the time period just before the end of "The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe," (roughly during the start of "Wardrobe''s" last chapter) and is largely independent of the other six Narnia books. All of the Narnia books can be read independently, but "Horse" in particular has little link to the others.The tale is a classic "young person escapes a bad life" story, and in the end becomes a classic "downtrodden young person saves the day" and a "young person of meager background is" - well, that would be giving something away. Time-tested clichés of the genre, to be sure, but not clichés in a bad way. In Lewis'' tale, this is a Good Thing. Because it works.The story concerns Shasta, a young boy, and a talking horse, Bree, who flee their evil masters in an attempt to reach the free land of Narnia to the north. In their flight they meet up with Aravis, a young girl also fleeing with a talking horse, Hwin. They adventure their way through the country of Calormen, a thinly-veiled substitute for the Middle Eastern countries of the real world.Like the best of children''s literature, the pacing is brisk and the obstacles to be overcome are introduced quickly and almost without pause.As in all the Narnia books, we are introduced to Aslan. This time Aslan''s role initially seems minor, but is revealed to have retroactively been a major role. It is among the worst uses of the lion in the series. Much of what the lions tells Shasta feel dreadfully like the famous poem "Footsteps," in which Jesus explains to a walker looking at his life traced in footsteps on the beach that those moments when there were but one set of footsteps, not two for the walker and Jesus, were moments when Jesus carried the walker through life, not the walker walking through his troubles alone. In "Horse," it slaps the reader from the story. Worse still is the fact that the entire meeting with Aslan is written in a gratingly worshipful tone that is horribly jarring; it does the story a great disservice. The scene, however, is mercifully short.Because "The Horse and His Boy" is a side adventure in Narnia more than anything else, it does not have as strong a connection, and therefore sentimental tug, as the rest of the books. Still, heavy-handed Aslan scene aside, "Horse" is a delightfully simple adventure about young people escaping a bad situation. Escapism is almost never a bad thing, especially for younger people who prefer to read over playing video games, and Lewis does it very well. Most readers will thoroughly enjoy this, even if it isn''t essential Narnia.');

Despite the title of the book, there are a smattering of female characters in some of the tales.  They rank with the standard fare of impetuous women that Hemingway likes to write about.The scope of the stories is quite broad, featuring painful topics such as abortion, breakup, heartbreak and being past ones prime.  The latter theme is taken up in THE UNDEFEATED,  THE KILLERS and FIFTY GRAND and later on re-appears in Hemingway''s THE OLD MAN AND THE SEA.  FIFTY GRAND, which details the demise of a washed-up boxer, is my favorite short story in this collection.Stories such as IN ANOTHER COUNTRY, and NOW I LAY ME introduce motifs that are echoed in A FAREWELL TO ARMS, which was published just a few years after MWW.Tho I''ve never been enamoured with the short story genre, Hemingway does rank as one of the best in the business - particularly in the American literary canon.

But it would be unfair to fault the authors and editors for this -- writing rigourously yet concisely about Modular Forms, Orbifields, Differential Topology, etc. is an impossible task for people with no background at all. Indeed an illustrative example would be the overview of trigonometric functions, which would likely be a chapter in a high school textbook but is covered in the Companion in a single page.To readers with a bit of mathematical background, however (perhaps a few proof-based courses in university), I reckon the Companion to be an invaluable reference for all areas of mathematics.');

In it, Nick is a very young boy, and, with his physician father, he has been present at a difficult childbirth and found the victim of a suicide.  Dawn is approaching and he is in the canoe with his father rowing back across the lake.Quote:"Do many men kill themselves, Daddy?""Not very many, Nick."..."Is dying hard, Daddy?""No, I think it''s pretty easy Nick.

Hemingway''s family was plagued by suicide, including that of his physician father, and, like all of us, Hemingway was once a young child coming to grips with the idea of mortality, in a world still fresh and fascinating and frightening.Other stories deal with the joys of a life full-lived, an appreciation of the natural world around us, and our "quiet desperation," in love, life, and death."The Nick Adams Stories" is high on my "Top Ten List."');

While incomplete as stories, they give insight into the creative process. Insofar as the stories Hemingway did publish, some are quite good: "Ten Indians", a story of adolescent love, rejection, and the resiliency of the teenage mind; "The Battler", a wonderful portrayal of mental illness among drifters and hobos; and "Fathers and Sons", a death meditation.Other stories, such as the famous "Big Two Hearted River" and "The Killers" are just not very good. What is the significance of "Big Two Hearted River" consisting of two parts? Beats the hell of me. And the entire story is about nothing but the rituals of fishing and camping, which Hemingway describes to the point of fetishization. There is something at the very end about the swamp being a "tragic" place to fish, but that there will be another time to confront it. Don''t be so obscure, Hem. What are you talking about? We''ll never know because the story is devoid as to what''s on Nick''s mind (See footnote below). And then "The Killers" is implausible: contract killers are not ingenue who intentionally leave evidence trails and toss out incriminating statements; and witnesses do call the cops.What I notice about all of the stories is that Hemingway mostly focuses on external things, and that little or nothing of the characters'' inner lives is revealed. Because details of hunting, fishing and camping are interesting to a point only, ultimately, I lose interest. Hemingway''s style is also annoying: he was too much the reporter and not enough the poet. Because he never sings, very little description is unique or memorable.We must remember that these stories were written and published in the 1920s and 1930s. At that time Art Deco - simple, unadorned, streamlined - was popluar. Perhaps Hemingway, like many great artists, subconsciously intuited the zeitgeist, or spirit of the time, and reflected that in his writing. Hemingway''s style and substance now seem dated. But at one time, like Art Deco, they were revolutionary. Perhaps that explains Hemingway''s once extraordinary popularity which seems incomprehensible now.FOOTNOTE: I have since discovered that such obscurity was intentional and evidently first applied during the writing of this story. Hemingway describes this literary device in "Hunger Was A Good Discipline", which appears on page 75 in A MOVEABLE FEAST, as his ". . . new theory that you could omit anthing if you knew you omitted and the omitted part would strengthen the story and make people feel something more than they understood. . . .

I''d probably give this book 3.5 stars, somewhere between it was good and it was OK, if I could.The first of the three sections of this novel is truly good.  It introduces us to Thomas Hudson, a painter and a thinly veiled Hemingway, and his life on the island of Bimini.  Hudson, like Hemingway, is an artist who is serious about his craft and about his work ethic.  We learn of his life among the characters of the island, including the locals and his friends.  The richest part of all is the visit of his three sons (by his first two wives) and the good times they share.  There is good character development of all three boys, each so different from the others and each showing different parts of their father''s personality.  And there are the friends and servants of Hudson''s, whom he loves and who play important parts in his son''s lives, often where it is difficult for a father to enter.  There is a tense shark attack and an epic battle with a monster marlin by the middle son, and there is a great deal of psychology of boys and men woven richly throughout.  Hudson is a father who can''t seem to love all-out, whole-heartedly, even though his sons need and want it.  The feelings are there but the wiring in Hudson''s head and heart shorts out a little and never conducts his deepest, truest self to his boys.  Tragically, Hudson learns of the death of his two youngest sons and their mother (his second wife) at the close of the story.The middle section of the book certainly has some good description and some realistic conversation, but overall it is one running conversation after another, mostly in the context of a bar where Hudson and his companions (who come and go) are drinking heavily, about very little of any importance.  Hudson has just gotten wind of his first son''s death (a pilot in WWII) and ultimately this accounts for the drinking but probably also for the attempts by Hudson to avoid any topic of significance in his conversations with others.  Hudson''s first wife and the only woman he ever deeply loved shows up and they have a rendezvous before Hudson can work up the fortitude to tell her of their son''s death.  They grieve and love together and she has to leave.  All in all, a draggy and hopeless section of this story that doesn''t live up to the first and last sections.The last section follows Hudson and his crew as they conduct anti-submarine activities from his small ship (or large boat) in and around Cuba.  The story is a game of cat and mouse in which Hudson and his crew is the cat and the surviving crew members from a German U-boat is the mouse.  Hemingway builds tension in the hunt and between Hudson''s crew members well.  There are some really exciting moments and some truly touching interaction between Hudson and his crew, as they must try to overcome their differences and dislikes of each other to band together to find and fight the enemy.  After the middle section this is a welcome change...there is actually stuff happening here, a plot.  But it does pail in comparison to the richness of the opening section of this book.All in all, I was glad I read this but the middle section prevents me from liking this book with anything close to whole-heartedness.  And if you are someone who enjoys happy endings, none of the three sections of this book end that way.  The reader is left thinking that likely, as the sons went, so the father goes.  There is much tragedy and hopelessness in this book, which too is a fair reflection of Hemingway''s own life.');

This is one of my favorite Hemingway books and one of the few published posthumously that lives up to his legacy.The book, broken into three distinct sections, recounts chapters in the life of Thomas Hudson, a somewhat thinly veiled version of Hemingway. That''s not to say that this is a story about Hemingway himself, but its pretty clear there is a lot of Hemingway in Hudson.The first section, considered by many to be the best (and, as a I recall, the focus of the film made of the book), takes place in Bimini, where Hudson is leading a fairly idyllic life. The second is centered in Cuba but has an entirely different tone from that of the first. Whereas the "Bimini" section is almost light-hearted and somewhat breezy, the tone of the Cuba section has changed dramatically. Hudson is now a depressed individual having lost a son in an accident. He has a reunion with his first wife, but even though she is the love of his life, he knows it won''t end happily. The third part, "At Sea," recounts Hudson''s efforts as a Nazi sub hunter.Hemingway is at his best throughout much of the book, his men are all striving to prove that they are, well, men, or at least the ideal of what a man should be in Hemingway''s eyes. And naturally enough, no Hemingway man, in this case Hudson, would be complete without a little tragedy in his life. "At Sea," while powerfully told, seems somehow incomplete, which may well be the case since I do not think Hemingway completed the book before his death. In fact, the ending seemed extremely abrupt and left me wondering, did Hudson survive his wounds?Still, this is some of Hemingway''s best work. A must read. The only reason I did not give it five stars is because of the abrupt ending and a few other brief passages in the book that seem somehow incomplete and unfinished.');

They''re American, of course, and to Hemingway the best way to be American is to spend as much time as possible in Europe.  As the title implies, the setting of David and Catherine''s romantic idyll is nothing short of paradise, a splendor of leisure, food, and drink -- and there is indeed a lot of drinking.One day Catherine returns to the hotel where she and David are staying with her hair cut short as a boy''s; this simple but suggestive act precipitates a flurry of homoerotic innuendoes that pervade the remainder of the novel.  At Cannes they meet a beautiful European girl named Marita who is attracted -- sexually -- to both of them, as they are to her.  She becomes their traveling companion and, with everybody''s consent, makes love to Catherine and then to David, but not, I''m afraid, at the same time.  If this menage a trois is supposed to represent the Fall, with Marita playing the role of the Serpent, it seems that Paradise is not yet lost.As a writer, David (like his creator) lets his life become his work, and he is currently inspired to write a story about elephant hunting with his father in Africa, a reminiscence of a transformative boyhood event.  Catherine, an idle and apparently rich girl with no professional aspirations of her own except to char herself to a crisp getting the darkest tan she can, is jealous of his work and the authorial attention he gets; Marita, also rich (Catherine frequently calls her Heiress), is more sympathetic to David''s intense artistic nature.  He is clearly too narcissistic to be in love with anybody but himself and his own work, and being married to him means having to accept that, which may be too much of a sacrifice for Catherine to make.Hemingway''s trademark is that he makes his characters so complex precisely by having them say so little.  The dialogue here is laconic and breezy, as though verbosity would be tedious in a place of such beauty and with people so blithe and lax.  The easy, free flow of the narrative, giving the impression of having been written on autopilot, belies the fact that Hemingway spent the last fifteen years of his life working on this novel sporadically, evidently putting a tremendous amount of consideration into the statement he wanted to make.  Like most of his statements, it bears his unmistakable stamp of restlessness and of impatience with the normal course of the world.');

I discovered this after reading the book in one of his biographical accounts.  It seems that he wrote this one to process out his inner feelings about the actual relationship he lived through.  I wonder how he felt in retrospect?  At times his main character David seems bitter about the whole thing.  At other times he is definitely caught up in it.  He is written much like a puppet, controlled by his wife and the circumstances he runs into.Catherine is one of the more complex female characters that Hemingway ever portrayed.  She reminds me of a more fleshed out Brett, from The Sun Also Rises.  Catherine has a very nihilistic view of life.  She seems driven to do everything in her power to destroy herself and all who cross her path.  She wants pleasure.  She wants to feel good about herself, but just can''t seem to find a way to acheive it.  Poor Catherine...  I couldn''t help but feel for her the whole way through the book.  She seems lost and unwilling to find her way or be found.I wonder if Hemingway was simply journaling on this experience, never wanting to share it at all?

It was first published in 1995, and considerable work has been done in genetic algorithms since then, but it could still serve as an adequate introduction.  Emphasizing the scientific and machine learning applications of genetic algorithms instead of applications to optimization and engineering, the book could serve well in an actual course on adaptive algorithms. The author includes excellent problem sets at the end of each chapter, these being divided up into "thought exercises" and "computer exercises", and in the latter she includes some challenge problems for the ambitious reader. Chapter 1 is an overview of the main properties of genetic algorithms, along with a brief discussion of their history. The role of fitness landscapes and fitness functions is clearly outlined, and the author defines genetic algorithms as methods for searching fitness landscapes for highly fit strings. An elementary example of a genetic algorithm is given, and the author compares genetic algorithms with more traditional search methods. The author emphasizes the unique features of genetic algorithms that distinguish them from other search algorithms, namely the roles of parallel population-based search with stochastic selection of individuals, and crossover and mutation. A list of applications is given, and two explicit examples of applications are given that deal with the Prisoner''s Dilemna and sorting networks. The author also gives a brief discussion as to how genetic algorithms work from a more mathematical standpoint, emphasizing the role of Holland schemas. The reader more prepared in mathematics can consult the references for more in-depth discussion. The next chapter stresses the role of genetic algorithms in problem solving, beginning with a discussion of genetic programming. Automatic programming has long been a goal of computer scientists, and the author discusses the role of genetic programming in this area, particularly the work of John Koza on evolving LISP programs. In addition, she discusses the current work on evolving cellular automata and its role in automatic programming. The latter discussion is more detailed, this resulting from the author''s personal involvement in artificial life research. Those interested in time series prediction tools will appreciate the discussion on the use of genetic algorithms to predict the behavior of dynamical systems, with an example given on predicting the behavior of the (chaotic) Mackey-Glass dynamical system. The author also gives applications of genetic algorithms in predicting protein structure, an area of application that has exploded in recent years, due to the importance of the proteome projects. The area of neural networks has also been influenced by genetic algorithms, and the author discusses how they have replaced the familiar back-propagation algorithm as a method to find the optimal weights. Chapter 3 is more in line with what the author intended in the book, namely a discussion of the relevance of genetic algorithms to study the mechanisms behind natural selection. She discusses the "Baldwin effect", which gives a connection between what an organism has learned (a small time-scale process) to the evolutionary history of the Earth (a long time-scale process). A simple model of the Baldwin effect is given using a genetic algorithm, along with a discussion of the Ackley-Littman evolutionary reinforcement learning model, which involves the use of neural networks, and which is another computational demonstration of the Baldwin effect. In addition, the author discusses models for sexual selection and ecosystems based on genetic algorithms. These are the "artificial life" models that the author has been involved in, and she gives a very understandable overview of their properties. Chapter 4 should suit the curiosity of the mathematician or computer scientist who wants to understand the theoretical justification behind the use of genetic algorithms. Again employing the Holland notion of schemas and adaptation as a "tension between exploration and exploitation", the author formulates a mathematical model, called the Two-Armed Bandit Problem, of how genetic algorithms are used to study the tradeoffs in this tension. The level of mathematics used here is very elementary with the emphasis placed on the intuition behind this model, with only a sketch of the model''s solution given. To address the role of crossover in genetic algorithms, the author discusses in detail a class of fitness landscapes, called "Royal Road functions" that she and others have developed. The performance of the genetic algorithm employed is then compared against the three different hill-climbing methods. Formal mathematical models of genetic algorithms are also discussed, one of which involves dynamical systems, another using Markov chains,  and one using the tools of statistical mechanics. The latter is very interesting from a physics standpoint but is only briefly sketched. The interested physicist reader can consult the references given by the author for further details. Practical use of genetic algorithms demands an understanding of how to implement them, and the author does so in the last chapter of the book. She outlines some ideas on just when genetic algorithms should be used, and this is useful since a newcomer to the field may be tempted to view a genetic algorithm as merely a fancy Monte Carlo simulation. The most difficult part of using a genetic algorithm is how to encode the population, and the author discusses various ways to do this. She also details various "exotic" approaches to improving the performance of genetic algorithms, such as the "messy" genetic algorithms. One must also choose a selection method when employing genetic algorithms, and the author shows how to do this using various techniques, such as roulette wheel and stochastic universal sampling. In addition, genetic operators must also be chosen in implementing genetic algorithms, and the author emphasizes crossover and mutation for this purpose. Lastly, the values of the parameters of the genetic algorithm, such as population size, crossover rate, and mutation rate must be chosen. The author discusses various approaches to this. Although brief, she does give a large set of references for further reading.');

All make some impact as de Bernieres adroitly builds her role.  Each chapter becomes a minor tale in its own right, with all tied together flawlessly.  Characters and events are imparted with meticulous detail, yet, like a Mozart opera, not one word would bear excision.If you like a story that successfully ranges over a variety of issues and people, you will seek far and wide to surpass this tale.  De Bernieres'' skills in portraying life''s complexities, yet maintaining reader attention and interest are peerless.  He has clearly build his work on thorough scholarship - there''s even a source list at the end.  His sweeping view will leave you exhilarated and breathless, but fulfilled.

Such a masterful mix of comedy and tragedy is rare, indeed. In parts I couldn''t stop laughing, much to my sleeping husband''s annoyance as I read it late into  the night. Then unstoppable tears would flow. De Berniers''s obvious love of  his characters, his painstaking research, his use of challenging vocabulary  that often sent me gleefully into the dictionary, his masterful unfolding  of plot -- all combined to keep me in continual awe of his writing. And  now, about THAT ending: Yes, there was a definite shift from the intricate  details of most of the book, which covered a relatively short period of  time. But to cover decades in that same detailed style would be utterly  impossible! (Unless it becomes a multi-volume epic, which I believe in this  case would be unsustainable.) I was impressed, actually, that De Berniers  was able to give enough details to make the unfolding of those decades not  too rushed. It was like travelling on a speeding train through the  landscape, but stopping long enough in some places to get one''s bearings,  get a decent feel for the time and place, and even go into some shops and  have a nice meal and a chat with the locals. I LIKED the way De Berniers  constructed the "bridge", then, from the war to the present, to  what we can see and experience on the island of Cephalonia today. As far as  the culmination of the love-story is concerned, without giving away the  ending, I found it satisfying and realistic. The characters remained  essentially consistent, although circumstances and their lives had  drastically changed. The criteria for a good ending, as far as I''m  concerned, is that I feel satisfied, that it feels "right", and  that I couldn''t completely predict it, although some hints were pointing me  in that general direction. It met those criteria for me.');

This short tale is of a family totally controlled and dominated by a father''s greed. The father actually weighs out eggs, butter, flour, and sugar for the family servant to use every day. His wife, daughter, and family servant all have adjusted their views of reality to accomodate his greed. The equilibrium is upset when Cousin Charles Grandet comes to visit. The women in the household cater to the needs of this handsome young man but the father is unsympathetic upon hearing that his brother has become bankrupt and a suicide and the young man is penniless. By the time the young man leaves, the daughter of the house is totally in love with him. She writes to Charles but after a few letters he fails to respond further to her letters. As the miserly father withers and dies, so too does the expectations and soul of his daughter, Eugenie. Balzac did a really fine job of showing how self defeating the miser''s greed was to his family and his relationship with his wife and child. After the death of the father, Eugenie inherits a fortune. Cousin Charles meanwhile has become rich through the slave trade between African and the Caribbean. His soul has shrunk and he is about to marry a 19 year old socialite for her family connections. He writes a letter telling Eugenie that he has never stopped loving her but that he must look out for his interests with this advantageous marriage. He receives a letter back that is polite yet biting, gracious yet revengeful, compassionate and understanding yet reminding of the lost opportunity. Charles then finds out that his cousin, whom he loves, is extremely wealthy and he has made a decision that he thought was advantageous which turned out to be less than optimal. Balzac has the faithful maid as the only winner in the story.  Eugenie rewards her for her years of hard work and service. The story resonates with Henry James'' Washington Square. They both involve a triangle between a rich father, an innocent daughter, and a suitor. The difference is that James'' father is cruel to his daughter thinking that since she is plain and shy that men will court her only for money. Eugenie''s father''s obsession was wealth, the effects on his family were a consequence of his greed, not due to his conscious demeaning sarcasm. Both heroines seek revenge on the suitor, James'' with a trick and Balzac''s with a superbly written letter that left the revenge to his own immagination and judgement. James'' suitor was indeed a crook, whereas Charles Grandet was lead into opportunism and missed chances. Finally, the Aunt in Washington Square was a silly gossip who was not supportive of the daughter/niece whereas the mother and servant in Eugenie Grandet were supportive of Eugenie. I would strongly recommend reading Eugenie Grandet, a concise,short, book. Balzac was just to his characters and this realistic justice made for a fine short novel.');

At the age of 20 years he already published more than a hundred books all describing very human characters, portrayed in a prose with an unseen force. Because the same characters appeared often in more than one book, Balzac created a universe of his own, which he himself called "La Comédie Humaine".In Eugénie Grandet, a novel dating from 1833, one gets acquainted with father Grandet, an extremely wealthy and greedy aristocrat living together with his wife and daughter in Saumur, France.  His daughter Eugénie has grown to maturity and her father has no other goal than to see her getting married. But who is suitable enough for his precious daughter? Surely not her adopted nephew Charles Grandet, not? Eugénie has to fight against the tyrannical power of her father, but gets help from their faithful servent, Nanon.Through this tragedy Balzac reveals one of the most destructive vices of man: greed. Although the author does not recoil from an ever-growing list of moralizing statements, the story stays authentic enough to pull the reader into the story. The comparison with a masterpiece as Wuthering Heights is easily made and not only because it dates from the same period. But to make from Eugénie Grandet a true classic it certainly misses depth.');

In the town of Saumur, M. Grandet is a wine merchant, a miser in full. This is a despicable man, but like good characters in literature, he has an understandable, if unjustifiable, reason for his behavior. He wants to give his family a perennial financial security. The problem is, that is all he wants for his family. Nothing else matters. So the family leads a monastical life, luxury is forbidden, joy is expensive. Eugenie is a likable but shy young lady, without any knowledge of the world whatsoever. Balzac is just great at creating the environment and mood. You can see the big, old house, the leaves fallen from the trees and rustling in the silent evenings of this town. You can feel the boredom of lifeless life, the long, long afternoons. The avaricious man lecturing everybody for spending like crazy, anguished at every penny spent, regardless of what was bought or consumed.So, two families are looking forward to having one of their sons married to Eugenie, but Daddy is looking for more wealth, and refuses to share his with these provincial people. Then his brother committs suicide in account of financial trouble, and Grandet''s nephew, Charles, comes to town. He and Eugenie fall in love, but there is no chance M. Grandet will accept a marriage with the son of a ruined man. Charles, thus, leaves for the Indies to look for fortune. Someday he''ll come back, but things will never be the same. As the years pass, we see Eugenie go on with her dull life, her heart saddened and cold.Balzac''s novel paints an accurate and believable portrait of French society at the time, but it would not have survived if that had been all. As the title of this review states, this work has transcended because it is literature of the higher sort, that which goes directly to the human heart and mind, to situations that do not pass with age, but remain embedded in any society. And because the writer is a master craftsman: Balzac is one of the best. Think of novel and think of Balzac, "competitor with the Civil Records": a rigorous analyst of human, and not only French, society.');

Well, having just had the experience (and it is an experience) of reading John Cleland''s 1748-9 novel, "Memoirs of a Woman of Pleasure," everything else just seems like children''s literature. Cleland''s "Memoirs" was simultaneously reviled and a best seller, declared obscene and yet continued to be published illegally througout the 18th century. In the aftermath of the public frenzy for and against Samuel Richardson''s ultra-famous novels "Pamela" and "Clarissa" and Henry Fielding''s equally famous responses, "Shamela," "Joseph Andrews," and "Tom Jones," Cleland''s novel strikes out into wholly uncharted moral and aesthetic territory.Similarly to Defoe''s "Moll Flanders," Cleland''s novel begins with its heroine, Fanny Hill, an innocent, uneducated country girl, thrown at a very early age into the cruel world of London and forced into a life of prostitution. As an innocent virgin, the madam whose house she live in is saving Fanny for a noble customer whom they expect daily, but learns about sexual commerce by watching other prostitutes in the house. Eloping with a beautiful, wealthy young man named Charles before she engages in any sexual activity, the novel concerns Fanny''s sexual awakenings and her life with and without her first love, Charles. The way that the novel refigures fidelity in the relationship between Fanny and Charles is astounding.Cleland''s master-stroke, if you will, linguistically, is to write a whole-heartedly pornographic novel and couch everything in such a rich variety of metaphors. Graphic scenarios can be found on almost every page, but there is a marked and remarkable absence of graphic language. Structurally, Cleland''s plotting of Fanny Hill''s escapades is exquisitely balanced and even-handed. Morally and aesthetically, "Memoirs" comes straight out of the strain of 18th century moral philosophy associated by turns, with Shaftesbury and David Hume. From Shaftesbury, Cleland takes the idea that aesthetics and morality should be judged on an equal form in works of art. From Hume, he takes the radical stance that vices and luxuries are not inherently evil, and even acceptable when not carried to extremes. Cleland makes judicious use of these structural and philosophical elements in creating one of the strongest and most liberated heroines in English literature.Among other points of interest in the novel, there is the prevalence and even propriety of expressions of feminine desire, agency, power, and control over self and circumstances. Aside from her first entrance into London and her various periods as a kept-mistress, Fanny Hill is educated by the prostitute Phoebe, and the procuress Mrs. Cole to be an independent, self-regulating subject. Related to this is the rather revolutionary notion inferred that sexual education predicates all other sources of knowledge, and is at heart, the basis and foundation of human interaction, at least in the semi-utopic world of the novel.There are so many fascinating things about Cleland''s "Memoirs of a Woman of Pleasure," it would take forever to puzzle through them all. All the same, I''ve only been able myself to think critically about the novel at some distance of remove from reading it. Reading this novel was an interesting, but frustrating, and at times impossible task. It''s not a difficult novel to read in terms of prose, but for a 188 page novel, it tends to overwhelm everything else while you''re reading it. Like I said, reading "Memoirs" is an experience - I often had to look at the cover to recall that this is no simple work of pornography, but an acknowledged work of classic literature. By all accounts, a captivating novel. It gets five stars just because it is so amazing and outlandish. Aside from the Marquis de Sade, who belongs properly to the excesses of the Romantic Era, I had no idea that there was anything even remotely like this in the 18th century.  To quote that immortal philospher, Stephon Marbury, Cleland''s novel is "all nude...but tastefully done."');

Unlike most porn, she''s not always happy about her sexual encounters, and there are times when she''s heartbroken over a lost love.  She''s decieved by a woman who claims to be hiring her "as a companion," in a another scene she''s exploited by a money-hungry landlord.As she grows older, though, Fanny becomes more in charge of her sexuality and more open to exploration.  We, as readers, also see a glimpse of 18th-century prostitution and the demimonde of kept mistresses (which many wealthy men of the period kept).Hardly a rollicking farce (there are times when sex has serious consequences) but at times it is humorous.  Never crass or vulgar, but nevertheless explicit, this bawdy gem is worth checking out.  Fanny is always honest about herself and what she does to survive, and pulls no punches.

Everything about the people in the novel seems so modern and no one ever thinks that the people of Cleland''s time even had thoughts or lives like he describes.Yet this novel has it''s problems too.The plot is an old one, young innocent country girl goes to the big city to seek her fortune and falls in the hands of some disreputable people.  It''s a story that''s as old as the profession the book is about.

The diamond carried a curse which brought trouble to whom ever possessed it.In brief "The Moonstone" is a suspenseful story of the gifting of the diamond to a young lady on her 18th birthday in 1848, its disappearance the same night and the subsequent search for it until 1850.The way the mystery is told is most interesting. Eleven different characters relating their role as well as to what they could personally attest to the robbery. This provides various views on what occurred and how the actions of others were interpreted.In these narratives the reader learns of the history of the diamond and it''s three Indian protectors, the gifting, the loss and the search for the diamond from a long-time servant in the country home of the wealthy family, the poor Christian spinster cousin who thrives on doing good work and spreading the faith. Two male cousins one a gambler and the other somewhat of a dilettante, both wishing to marry the same cousin. The wealthy side of the family, the family solicitor, the village doctor and his assistant, a police sargent who specializes in family thefts and roses, and a well traveled man with certainty some Indian heritage. It provides an interesting cross-section of life in Victorian England.It is one of the earliest mystery novels written, and was serialized, likely in a newspaper, when first published.

Other reviewers  can do this in a more lengthy and detailed fashion, but  I had not read this since 1952 when it was a major item on an advanced course in American literature when it was cited for two achievements by Hemingway.  The first and most outstanding is style which originates with his job as a journalist with the Toronto Daily Star.  That paper''s style book was the guide for Hemingway in all his writings - both journalistic and fictional. The second characteristic was the structure of his story where the major element was unstated in narrative, leaving the impact to the imagination as it was sketched by the actions and words of his characters. In the case of The Sun Also Rises, the style is obviously a significant departure from the Victorian sludge that demanded lengthy artistic passages depicting settings and motivations.  In this book, Jake''s sexual impotence due to a wartime aircraft accident is not only understated but dealt by ellipses.  But also with Hemingway, the impact of frustrated passion by Lady Brett and Jake is defined by sexual frustration, not love.  A real love would have found ways for them to live together and get around the problem. I find Hemingway''s approach is more typical of his macho testosterone obsession with  everything. While sexual attraction and fulfillment (and some will say procreation)  is the essence of relations between a man and a woman, wiser heads know that real love is found in the deeper relationships between personalities as well as the flesh.Moreover, I think the so-called "lost generation" thing is overdone, as is the bullfight nonsense.  Because a few artists, writers and wannabes gathered at the pumps on the Left Bank does not make them typical of a generation - what was typical in my opinion was the revulsion from the war and its affect on  Western civilization.  Most people got on with the job of having kids - establishing families - out of the personal wreckage of the war. In short, I felt the story was overblown as a universal of the times.Finally, a note about the Kindle version which I downloaded. All of Hemingway''s novels which I have recently read in Kindle suffer from word breaks and elisions and mis-scanned letters. Of course at the price one can hardly complain or expect word-by-word.editing.But all-told,an interesting and useful refresher to the world of Hemingway - but there are story lines that I like much better: as examples: "For Whom The Bell Tolls" and "A Farewell to Arms".

On this 1933-34 African safari, his jovial, Socratic drinking pal "Pop" is actually Phillip Percival the famous white hunter  who conducted Theodore Roosevelt on his first African safari.  As a young  man, Hemingway owned a copy of TR''s book "African Game Trails,"  and it is undoubtedly one of the reasons he went on this safari, which was  financed to the tune of $25,000 Depression dollars by his wife Pauline''s  uncle Gus, part owner of Richard Hudnut cosmetics.  Further evidence of  Hem''s fascination with Africa can be seen in the way Jake Barnes teases  Robert Cohn in "The Sun Also Rises."  In chapter two, Jake says,  " Did you ever think about going to British East Africa to  shoot?"  Cohn''s lack of enthusiasm for an immediate trek to Mombassa  seals his fate as a jerk.  "Green Hills" vindicates Hem''s real  aficion for hunting--filled with long descriptions of the arduous and  sometimes futile tracking of game, not just celebratory "kills."  Finally, the best preparation for reading "The Short Happy Life of  Francis Macomber" and "The Snows of Kilimanjaro" is to hike  and sweat through these 300 pages of African "country."  The  long, crescent-horned sable which Hem was painstakingly stalking at the end  of "Green Hills" never turned up.  But instead, the experience of  his African safari, was distilled into those two incredible stories--one  about a coward who gets a chance to redeem himself and the other about a  washed-up writer whose approaching death stimulates him to dream about--and  the reader to enjoy--the fiction he never got to actually write.  Unless  you''ve got a rich uncle or wife, this is as close as you''ll get to an East  African safari, and it is very, very fine.');

It went a  long way in establishing Hemingway''s reputation as a hunter and adventurer.  Though non-fiction it has the organization of a Hemingway novel and reads  much like his other works.  His descriptions of the landscape, local  people, other hunters, and especially animals, hunting, and killing are  superb.  Hemingway also shares, mostly as dialogue, his thoughts on life,  war, fate, and notably literature and the literary life.  His often-quoted  idea of all American literature being descended from one book by Mark Twain  is presented here, as are his thoughts on how America destroys its writers.  Some knowledge of Eastern Africa (such as a basic history, a guidebook, an  encyclopedia article) might be useful as Hemingway often does provide much  introductory material.  With "Green Hills of Africa" Hemingway  follows in the footsteps of Theodore Roosevelt''s "African Game  Trails"; both did much to popularize among Americans the idea of  recreational travel in Africa.  Hemingway went on to write two fictional  stories set in Africa: "The Snows of Kilimanjaro" and "The  Short Happy Life of Francis Macomber".

On one level it''s a recounting of a big-game safari that Hemingway undertook with one of his many wives (referred to only by initials, POM) and two of their friends - Karl, whom he finds himself rivalling in a bid to bag the best game; Mr JP or Pop, in real life an acclaimed hunter/guide who apparently accompanied Roosevelt on a safari.The details can be a bit confusing as the four of them move, sometimes together and sometimes separately, across a lot of African country that is differentiated only by the quality of its game and a lot of long African names that are impossible to keep track of.  Otherwise it''s easygoing - this is Hemingway''s simple direct prose at its best, and probably the most readable of his books that I''ve come across so far.  There is a simplicity and contentment in his writing that evokes very well the lifestyle they led, untroubled by anything except the desire to shoot the perfect kudu; each day spent in a beautiful country eating, reading, walking and hunting, then going to sleep and waking to do the exact same things; where all triumphs and tragedies are to do with hunting and no world beyond that exists.  For once Hemingway even has a happyending!  It''s certainly an eye-opener for the majority of us who, not being rich white expatriates in a time when environmentalism and animal rights hardly merited concern, will never embark on a safari.  The fact that it''s wholly non-fiction is a trifle surprising, for events build up to a convenient climax, and the ending contains convenient closure.Delve a little deeper and Hemingway allows us to accompany him through his thoughts - his reflections on Africa, hunting, writing, living.  He has a knack for looking at things in an unique light, reducing concepts down to simple terms and insisting that this is the way things are... Also, an idea of the author himself - the type of person he is - is built up quite clearly, more so than in ''A Moveable Feast''.

INSERT INTO public."Reviews" (review_id, user_id, book_id, rating, review) VALUES (2752, 2119, 178, 5, 'Jurgis Rudkis was a young Lithuanian with a dream of betterment - a dream better met in America than where he lived.  At the start of the 20th century, he and a group of similarly hopeful Lithuanians made their pilgrimage to the beating heart of capitalism, only to find the heel of its boot.  After navigating their way to Chicago’s meat packing district, the families endure extreme hardship and the brutal underside rather than uplifting promise of capitalism.The Jungle draws comparison to other tales of hardship – for example Faulkner’s The Grapes of Wrath – but Sinclair offers a twist.  Rather than a study of characters caught up in an epic event such as the Depression-era Dust Bowl, Sinclair uses his characters’ hardship to critique the setting itself.  More specifically, the characters are a vehicle to highlight the uneven and immoral impacts of capitalism, and to deliver a lesson in left-leaning (socialist?) economics and politics.Sinclair advances his theme in four stages.  First, in the largest section, he chronicles the dehumanizing work in Chicago’s meat packing district and the revolting methods the plant owners use to pass off inedible meat to unwitting consumers.  If it’s not enough to make readers question the balance of power between labor and capital, it will certainly make them rethink what they eat.The second, shorter stage shows Jurgis via a scrape with the law up against the broader industrial/political/media complex.  It’s not so much that the law is stacked against Jurgis; the justice is perfunctory and with the barest standards of due process.  Rather, it is the systemic intertwining political and industrial connections of others accused and acquitted, and of those meting out justice that rankles Sinclair.  “Government existed under the form of a democracy. The officials who ruled it, and got all the graft, had to be elected first; and so there were two rival sets of grafters, known as political parties, and the one got the office which bought the most votes.”The third stage - an interlude, really - follows Jurgis as a hobo after turning his back on Chicago, capitalism, and the social contract.  He lives by his wits when a chance encounter permits him inside a meat packing industrialist’s mansion.  The unneeded, undeserved and unproductive wealth stands in stark contrast to laborers’ deprivation and drives home Sinclair’s message about unfettered capitalism.  Jurgis’ life as a hobo, outside the capital/labor struggle, harkens back to an idyllic (Edenic, not Hobbesian) time before capitalism, and foreshadows the possibility of another path … but not before Jurgis takes a turn working within the power structure, which proves less punishing than as a laborer but equally unfruitful.The fourth stage reconciles the plot elements of the first three stages and presents a socialist alternative.  “In America everyone had laughed at the mere idea of Socialism then — in America all men were free.  As if political liberty made wage slavery any the more tolerable!”  The Hobbesian bargain had metastasized under the natural power imbalances of capitalism, just as Marx had warned a few decades earlier, and the promise of socialism offered Jurgis a third path.  He need not choose between the perpetually antagonistic labor and capital, but rather from a third option, in which one could select a job and receive remuneration based upon his or her contribution (labor hours and skill), all of which would advance broader societal goals.  Government (rather than the oppressive capitalists) would establish the value of labor contributions.  Sinclair envisioned a workers’ movement which would gently rule, and progress would be guided by ‘an invisible hobo hand’.Written after both Adam Smith’s and Marx’s theorizing but before the Russian Revolution, history has since shown the weakness of Sinclair’s concluding sermon, and even the labor theory of value that Sinclair touts was being supplanted when the book was written.  Still, The Jungle is a seminal and cautionary tale of the power struggle between capital and labor.  It applies equally well to the disposability of labor in today’s era of globalization and automation, and perhaps to intellectual capital in the coming era of Artificial Intelligence.Sinclair’s plot is straightforward – simply a vehicle to critique the capitalist system – and offers none of the rollicking twists in Dickens’ working-class novels.  Nor does it feature the robust character development of other authors.  What it does offer is one of the first literary indictments of unfettered capitalism, and for this it should be read by all with an interest in politics and economics.');

Everybody goes through some dose of solitude through life, and it''s nice to be able to reflect through Marquez''s characters. What is interesting for me though is that most of the characters would be committed into instructions or jailed in our modern societies. However, with all their idiosyncrasies, obsessive-compulsiveness, and plain madness, they all managed to go through their existences long before the advent of mind-numbing medications.Life was sure simpler, and far more entertaining back in this era. I would recommend this book, to anybody who wants to expand their literary horizons, and their understanding of some dark corners of human nature.I can only hope that Marquez is spending the last days of his life at peace with his solitude...');

In today''s time and age, ''love story'' carries a connotation that isn''t really fitting for this book, but I hope ''epic'' captures this.What''s most brilliant about Márquez is how he vividly captures the imagination and leads you into this world, where you feel that you are living the lives of the characters and you learn about them. In this manner, you also learn a lot about your own life and human nature in general, which makes his work powerful.Furthermore, in describing these lives from mundane details to the extraordinary, he weaves in a subtle social commentary regarding such diverse topics as gender relations, race, class, politics. The thing that strikes me the most about this is that he does this all without becoming ''preachy'' but in the subtlest fashion.It leaves you with a sense of the power of love, a love that is currently not in fashion, but also with the sense that the Caribbean and Latin American in general is constantly ravaged by war, disease, and corruption that continues unabated for almost a century.');

Hardy sees these as being transient and subject to great change even within a society. The novel is replete with references to differences in religious creed and how these foster intolerance - between high and low Anglicanism and with both to Roman Catholicism. The novel shows great  families falling into obscurity and other families assuming great histories to which they are not entitled. The conventions that enable these are not eternal. They are not inevitable. They have a beginning and they have an end. And yet, as Hardy shows, they claim the power to regulate the lives of human beings even to the point of condemnation. Tess is condemned  by a double standard that excuses the more powerful elements of a society. It is these social conventions  that Hardy identifies as transient and not eternal. he doubts their legitimacy. That is the main theme of the novel.');

For Pelagia Iannis the cost of transition is heavy.  Daughter of the village''s widower doctor, she is caught up in global forces beyond her ken.  The imperial ambitions of Italy''s dictator, Benito Mussolini, bring the Italian army of occupation.  Among the troops is Captain Antonio Corelli, artillery officer and musician.  An unwitting and hesitant imperial minion, he is billeted in the Iannis household.  Although the doctor urges passive resistance, Pelagia, although committed to a partisan youth, is drawn to Corelli''s musical talents and unworldly charm.  De Bernieres weaves an intricate tale of love, war, humour and pathos with unrivaled skill.  His characters sparkle with realism, an aspect permeating this outstanding work.  His descriptions of the interactions of the differing nationalities and ideologies ring vividly true.As he builds the story through the characters and events, de Bernieres gives little away.  There are continual surprises as events twist and bend the characters.  Some break, others find a means to extricate themselves from a tangling fate.  Pelagia bears the main burden throughout.  Her love for Corelli, after a fitful start, blossoms, then is tested by the swirl of events.  Other characters come into her life, remain or depart.  All make some impact as de Bernieres adroitly builds her role.  Each chapter becomes a minor tale in its own right, with all tied together flawlessly.  Characters and events are imparted with meticulous detail, yet, like a Mozart opera, not one word would bear excision.If you like a story that successfully ranges over a variety of issues and people, you will seek far and wide to surpass this tale.  De Bernieres'' skills in portraying life''s complexities, yet maintaining reader attention and interest are peerless.  He has clearly build his work on thorough scholarship - there''s even a source list at the end.  His sweeping view will leave you exhilarated and breathless, but fulfilled.

Such a masterful mix of comedy and tragedy is rare, indeed. In parts I couldn''t stop laughing, much to my sleeping husband''s annoyance as I read it late into  the night. Then unstoppable tears would flow. De Berniers''s obvious love of  his characters, his painstaking research, his use of challenging vocabulary  that often sent me gleefully into the dictionary, his masterful unfolding  of plot -- all combined to keep me in continual awe of his writing. And  now, about THAT ending: Yes, there was a definite shift from the intricate  details of most of the book, which covered a relatively short period of  time. But to cover decades in that same detailed style would be utterly  impossible! (Unless it becomes a multi-volume epic, which I believe in this  case would be unsustainable.) I was impressed, actually, that De Berniers  was able to give enough details to make the unfolding of those decades not  too rushed. It was like travelling on a speeding train through the  landscape, but stopping long enough in some places to get one''s bearings,  get a decent feel for the time and place, and even go into some shops and  have a nice meal and a chat with the locals. I LIKED the way De Berniers  constructed the "bridge", then, from the war to the present, to  what we can see and experience on the island of Cephalonia today. As far as  the culmination of the love-story is concerned, without giving away the  ending, I found it satisfying and realistic. The characters remained  essentially consistent, although circumstances and their lives had  drastically changed. The criteria for a good ending, as far as I''m  concerned, is that I feel satisfied, that it feels "right", and  that I couldn''t completely predict it, although some hints were pointing me  in that general direction. It met those criteria for me.');

After meeting with the ancient Mother Crone, Tal agrees to help sneak Milla in, so they can both find Sunstones -- he for his family, she for her people.But they have more trouble. After getting inside and consulting with Uncle Ebbitt, he tells them that they must find the Codex in Aenir. Then things take a hideous turn: The two kids are captured. Tal is imprisoned in the Pit -- and discovers something about his father''s fate. And Milla is trapped with the half-shadow-half-man monster Fashnek, in the Hall of Nightmares...Though "Castle" is not as strong as "Fall," it''s a darker, weirder story that adds to the mystery. Why does Sushin hate Tal and his family so much? What is happening to the Sunstones, if they''re dying and becoming useless? And who was the mysterious Longface, a Chosen taken in by the Icecarls -- what was he terrified of?Nix''s talent for fantastical horror is also more evident here, in the hideous Fashnek, who has an insectile shadow-claw over part of his body. While "Fall" was pretty much pure fantasy, "Castle" has the darker, more macabre bits -- probably even more as the series progresses. And his talent for creating familiar but alien cultures now extends to the Icecarls as well as the Chosen.Tal was a well-rounded character to start with, and he doesn''t disappoint in this book. Milla gets a bit more depth, and shows some liking for Tal and Uncle Ebbitt. She softens a little bit, while being no less tough. Uncle Ebbit is likably quirky, but more serious, and the Mother Crone is an intriguing old wisewoman.The second part of the "Seventh Tower" series is a little darker than the first book, and a little more of what fans expect from Nix. And he knows when to stop, just to make them dash eagerly for "Aenir."');

In the last book, The Fall, Tal is hurled away form the castle to be found by Icecarls, a nomadic people that follow animal migrations for survival.  Milla, an Icecarl girl, is ordered to help Tal get back to the castle and, in return, get a new sunstone for her clan''s iceship.  In this book Tal and Milla get back to the castle only to find that Tal''s family is on the wrong side of a political power play.  Tal''s father disappeared in the first book and now his younger brother appears to have been kidnapped.  With his mother ill and his sister forced to live with a couple of very nasty relatives, Tal turns to his eccentric Great-Uncle Ebbitt for help.  After many narrow escapes, Tal and Milla enter the spirit word of the Chosen, of which Tal''s family are members, in order to find a book that may help them solve the mystery of Tal''s father''s disappearance.In the first book Nix tears down traditional gender roles.  He continues to do that in this book while at the same time rounding out the major characters personalities.  We begin to see more sides of both Tal and, especially, Milla.  In this book Nix also starts to address the cultural arrogance that both Tal and Milla have learned from their societies.  I think Nix has a great way of addressing some of the major social concerns of today''s society in an a manner that''s easily digestible for the intended age group for this book.  He does so with an intriguing and well written story.  I think that the book (and series) will appeal to both boys and girls since the both heros play an equal role in the story and both are dependent on the other equally for survival.  If fact, at the end of this book both Tal and Milla realize just that.I highly recommend this book.  It''s enlightening and it''s a terrific fantasy.');

I really liked how 13-year-old Tal and 14-year-old Milla learned how to work together despite their differences. What''s really cool is how neither Tal nor Milla change who they are for the other person (though their characters DO grow) and still manage to form a team. Now we don''t really know that Tal and Milla like each other, necessarily, and they still argue and tease each other, but as the two face more challenges - sometimes even apart (they get separated and Tal faces the Pit while Milla gets tossed into the Hall of Nightmares), they find ways to get back together and to help one another.

That, I think, is the point of the novel.  The changes brought about to Sulaco by the use of foreign capital and technology brought about stability, peace and prosperity. They were beneficent to the population. The harm they brought was indirect, subtle and inevitable. This is not an action/adventure novel. it is a classic tragedy.The novel is based on the contrast between two characters - Nostromo, the title character, and Charles Gould. it is important that both of these characters are foreigners to the region - Nostromo - Genoese and Gould English as well as Costaguanan. It is also important that they go by multiple names Nostromo, Gian Battista, Captain Fidanza, and the Capitaz and Charles Gould as Don Carlos, Charles, Charley and the administrator of the San Tome mine. This is important because these names are not just different labels for the same persons but notifiers for personas that have markedly different social and personal implications. A major theme of this book is that the economic forces created by the new technologies introduced to the region affect the personalities of these characters. These impersonal forces change what they value and how they act. Both Gould and Nostromo become captives of the silver from the mines. They lose things that that are valuable in their lives. The things they value are changed. They do not do this by conscious choice but unconsciously with the impetus of these outside influences.The changes in Costaguna are beneficial and harmful at the same time. They bring peace and prosperity but the old community that existed there is inevitably lost. This is not an adventure novel. It is not a tale of fighting and daring-do. It is a novel in which the plot is moved forward within the description of characters. It is an analysis of the economic forces which shape values and which shapes how people live. It is a tragedy because these changes have good and ill contained inescapably within them.');

A novel of huge scope and political intrigue, it is also a novel in which no character actually wins.  All must accept the ironies which fate has dealt them.  Setting the novel in the imaginary South American country of Costaguana, the story centers around a silver mine in the mountains outside of the capital, Sulaco, vividly depicting its allure and the price each character pays for its success.When Charles Gould, returns from England to claim and reopen the rich silver mine he has inherited from his father, he has good intentions-- to provide jobs for the peasants and contribute to the economy of the town at the same time that he also profits.  Soon, however, he becomes obsessed with wealth and power, and as the political climate gets hotter, he must pay off government officials, bandits, the church, and various armed revolutionaries to be able to work.  Each of these groups is vividly depicted as working for its own ends and not for the good of the people, and with their goals focused on the real world, these characters have no self-awareness, nor do they develop it during the novel.In contrast to these "unrealized" humans, Conrad presents several characters who develop some self-awareness through their experiences.  Nostromo, a local legend, is a man of principle who has always kept his word.  Martin Decoud, a newspaper man, is a nihilist who has editorialized against the revolution, though he has yet to test himself.  Dr. Monygham, captured during a past revolution, broke under torture, and is now seeking absolution by fighting against this revolution. And the good and long-suffering wife of Charles Gould, Dona Emilia, who has lost her husband to his silver mine, now devotes her life to helping others.When Nostromo agrees to protect a load of silver from revolutionaries by taking it out to sea, he takes Decoud with him, leaving him on an island with the silver when they almost sink.  Decoud''s reaction to his isolation, and Nostromo''s reaction to the treasure that is suddenly "his," provide a dark commentary on idealism and human nature.  In the conclusion, which includes a love story that feels tacked on, Conrad''s darkest self is revealed, offering little hope of change and even less hope for man''s redemption.  Rich in atmosphere, vibrant in description, filled with characters representing all walks of life and philosophy, and set in a country where revolution is a way of life, the novel is full of dark portents and bleak political outcomes.

Alongside the larger group of natives and other people of color or lower class there is a small core group of Europeans, among those the Goulds.  In spite of being third generation South American Charles Gould still goes to England to find a wife.  Later when he decides to develop the silver mine he inherits from his father he goes to the United States to find a rich investor.  The silver mine becomes a huge success, only to become the target of political revolutionaries, and the story really begins when there is an attempted coup and takeover of the silver mine.  Much attention is given to inner conflicts and tough moral choices that individuals are forced to.Detailed descriptions of both characters and settings makes this novel quite a dense reading experience, particularly the first section which contains very little dialogue and reads like a documentary.

Tal knows that if he doesn''t find a primary sunstone, chances are she will die. This sends young Tal out on a dangerous journey through the castle he lives in. He knows that he only has so much time and must do anything he can to receive this primary sunstone. Unfortunately people seem to be working against his quest to receive a sunstone. It looks like his only hope is to steal a sunstone, and the only way he can do that is to climb up the castle and penetrate the mysterious vale where the sunstones are stored.Garth Nix is probably best known for his dark YA series (starting with Sabriel) that takes you into a mysterious world known as the old Kingdom where the Abhorsen is peoples only protection against dangerous necromancers.

It''s filled with fascinating characters and dark and mysterious creatures. It has a strong female character and a new and original world. The Castle is a mysterious place where what you''re class is means everything. Unfortunately, it''s not quite as gripping and addicting as Sabriel, possibly because it''s written in a much different style. The Seventh Tower series was made for a much younger audience so it doesn''t posses the enthralling descriptions and complex characterization as Sabriel. Still the book is very good.

Rather, both genders portray a  complete range of personalities; from the compassionate male hero to the  violent girl (Milla) that wants to kill Tal but resists out of loyalty to  her clan and because she gave her word to her clan''s (female) leader.

My only complaint is that this book is not a  complete story in and of itself as are the Harry Potter books or Ursula Le  Guin''s Earthsea series.  It leaves the reader hanging at the end with no  idea of when part two will be written.  But that is a minor complaint and  inspite of that I highly recommend it.  In todays world it''s important that  boys have compassionate male heros and understand that females can be just  as violent as males.  Likewise, girls have to understand that boys aren''t  weak just because they aren''t physical and that girls can be strong both  physically and mentally.

There were also spelling errors. At times it ran clearly and smoothly, then seemed to sort of hit the skids, becoming laboured, and again, poorly written/edited. I do generally like Eric Nylund as an author, but whoever his editor is, needs to be fired. So, again, I DID generally like the overall story, but it was very annoying to read along, and then hit places filled with really stupid errors. Tor publishing should look closer at it''s products, before letting them ship out.');

The story follows their training to a planet, Black Onyx.  There, the Covenant, Humanity, and the Forerunners clash in a battle royal that tests the mettle of the best and bravest that humanity has to offer.This book isn''t incredibly deep in terms of plot or morals, but the characters are decent (other than the Dr.), and the plot moves along at a good pace.  The action is good, and the tactics and techno-geek is enough to keep you interested throughout the book.So if you''re looking for deep sci-fi to engage you, this isn''t the right book.  Try Starship Troopers instead.  If you''re looking for a quick, fun read about man versus aliens with really cool gear, this is the book for you.');

In fact, it was quite a sudden discovery in a local college bookstore and now a whole new world dramatically opens up to a diehard fan of anthropomorphic animals like myself ever since the good old days of Pogo and Wind in the Willows. Here this tale takes  place about two badger brothers, one an albino and the other one a lord of  the seaside Salamanderstron mountain taking revenge upon a blue-eyed weasel  and his bloodthirsty gang for killing their parents when they were both  helpless little newborns. And the humble inhabitants of the Redwall Abbey  are suddenly drawn into the bold new epic that involves alot of warmaking,  scheme-hatching, journeying into the perilous unknown, fighting an  unexpected epidemic and a sea monster, and such courageous exploits that  will send a shiver running down your backbone every time you come across  those parts. And an inexperienced young squirrel and his mole buddy as well  as a plucky young badger girl and her shrew allies very quickly gets caught  in the skin-chilling whirlwind as the great badger fiercelly strikes out at  his old enemies from the past. And I must warn you, you WILL get caught as  well!');

She is rebellious and resentful of her father''s authority over her.  Her best friend is a hare called Pikkle Ffolger.Mara and Pikkle meet a charismatic young weasel, Klitch.  Little do they know that Klitch is the son of Ferahgo the Assassin, a ruthless weasel warlord.  Ferahgo and his army are making plans to besiege and conquer Salamadastron, and they mean to take Mara and Pikkle as hostages.Meanwhile, at Redwall Abbey, a young squirrel named Samkim and his mole friend, Arula, are busy getting into trouble because of their penchant for archery.  During a thunderstorm, the sword of Martin the Warrior is blown down from the weathervane and lands next to Samkim.One day, two ragged, filthy stoats named Dingeye and Thura show up at the Abbey gates, begging for shelter.  Abbess Vale reluctantly lets them into the Abbey; they cause trouble and tragedy and end up stealing the sword.  Samkim and Arula pursue them.  Samkim and Mara meet, and they are both catapaulted into the desperate struggle to save Salamadastron.This book also has a side plot involving an epidemic at Redwall Abbey and a journey to find the remedy.  There is also a mysterious haunted island and a mischievous baby mouse, as well as the Guosim.  Although "Salamandastron" might seem slightly boring in comparison with the previous four books in the series, it is still a worthwhile book to read.');

I think anyone who thinks it''s stupid IS STUPID, not to be rude, though.  Feahrgro (I think that''s spelled wrong), is one of the worst  most evil villians in Redwall history! He and his braty son Klitch.  Those  two never got along, and when some vermin turned against their evil leader  and tried to kill him, Feahrgro thought his son hired them to, so he really  didn''t trust Klitch.  I thought Klitch was idiotic to kill himself, even  though he didn''t mean to.  He should have known.  I liked the good guys  much more, and the way that Urthwyte was found, and how everybody came  together.  It was sad in some parts, but that didn''t change how much I  loved it! I love this series a whole lot, and I think that people of all  ages should try it out!');

It is a book that you can''t put down. Not only does it contain a great, exciting adventure, but also it unlocks a new place in the World of Redwall that holds a key spot. I recommend it to anybody who likes to read between the ages of Ten and Fifty. You might think that a book about animals running around would be childish, but it isn''t. Young kids have trouble comprehending the older kid/adult-directed words, and the story is great. Believe me. Try a book from this series, no matter who you are. This is a great book to start with, because it has such a great stroy and such a thrilling adventure.');

She was adopted by Lord Urthstripe,the badger who rules Salamandastron. Mara and her hare friend, Pikkle Ffolger runs away from the mountain. Then, an evil weasel assasin named Ferahgo attacks the mountain because (of course) he wants it and the badger treasure he heard of. He''s so EVIL!! This is a book you''ll just HAVE to read!!

For some reason, Jacques latter works are not as good as  his earlier ones; they are still good, don''t get me wrong.  Its just that  he spends less time on the characters and details than he used to.  Anyway,  this is the best, and then there''s Martin the Warrior, which is WONDERFUL.  Read both of them.
