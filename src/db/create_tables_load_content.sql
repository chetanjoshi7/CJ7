Set against the tragic love of Anna and Vronsky, the plight of the melancholy nobleman Konstantine Levin unfolds.  In doubt about the meaning of life, haunted by thoughts of suicide, Levin’s struggles echo Tolstoy’s own spiritual crisis.  But Anna''s inner turmoil mirrors the own emotional imprisonment and mental disintegration of a woman who dares to transgress the strictures of a patriarchal world.  In Anna Karenina, Leo Tolstoy brought to perfection the novel of social realism and created a masterpiece that bared the Russian soul.', 10.84, 223);

In early manhood an admirer of Socrates, he later founded the famous school of philosophy in the grove Academus. Much else recorded of his life is uncertain; that he left Athens for a time after Socrates'' execution is probable; that later he went to Cyrene, Egypt, and Sicily is possible; that he was wealthy is likely; that he was critical of ''advanced'' democracy is obvious. He lived to be 80 years old. Linguistic tests including those of computer science still try to establish the order of his extant philosophical dialogues, written in splendid prose and revealing Socrates'' mind fused with Plato''s thought.In Laches, Charmides, and Lysis, Socrates and others discuss separate ethical conceptions. Protagoras, Ion, and Meno discuss whether righteousness can be taught. In Gorgias, Socrates is estranged from his city''s thought, and his fate is impending. The Apology (not a dialogue), Crito, Euthyphro, and the unforgettable Phaedo relate the trial and death of Socrates and propound the immortality of the soul. In the famous Symposium and Phaedrus, written when Socrates was still alive, we find the origin and meaning of love. Cratylus discusses the nature of language. The great masterpiece in ten books, the Republic, concerns righteousness (and involves education, equality of the sexes, the structure of society, and abolition of slavery). Of the six so-called dialectical dialogues Euthydemus deals with philosophy; metaphysical Parmenides is about general concepts and absolute being; Theaetetus reasons about the theory of knowledge. Of its sequels, Sophist deals with not-being; Politicus with good and bad statesmanship and governments; Philebus with what is good. The Timaeus seeks the origin of the visible universe out of abstract geometrical elements. The unfinished Critias treats of lost Atlantis. Unfinished also is Plato''s last work of the twelve books of Laws (Socrates is absent from it), a critical discussion of principles of law which Plato thought the Greeks might accept.The Loeb Classical Library edition of Plato is in twelve volumes.', 34.09, NULL);

In Memoirs of a Geisha, we enter a world where appearances are paramount; where a girl''s virginity is auctioned to the highest bidder; where women are trained to beguile the most powerful men; and where love, always elusive, is scorned as illusion.  Sayuri''s story begins in a poor fishing village in 1929, when, as a nine-year-old with unusual blue-gray eyes, she is taken from her home and sold into slavery to a renowned geisha house. Through her eyes, we see the decadent heart of Gion--the geisha district of Kyoto--with its marvelous teahouses and theaters, narrow back alleys, ornate temples, and artists'' streets. And we witness her transformation as she learns the rigorous arts of the geisha: dance and music; wearing kimono, elaborate makeup and hair; pouring sake to reveal just a touch of inner wrist; competing with a jealous rival for men''s solicitude and the money that goes with it. But as World War II erupts and the geisha houses are forced to close, Sayuri, with little money and even less food, must reinvent herself all over again to find a rare kind of freedom on her own terms.Memoirs of a Geisha is a book of nuances and vivid metaphor, of memorable characters rendered with humor and pathos.

R. Martin’s monumental epic cycle of high fantasy. Now, in A Feast for Crows, Martin delivers the long-awaited fourth book of his landmark series, as a kingdom torn asunder finds itself at last on the brink of peace . . . only to be launched on an even more terrifying course of destruction.A FEAST FOR CROWSIt seems too good to be true. After centuries of bitter strife and fatal treachery, the seven powers dividing the land have decimated one another into an uneasy truce. Or so it appears. . . . With the death of the monstrous King Joffrey, Cersei is ruling as regent in King’s Landing. Robb Stark’s demise has broken the back of the Northern rebels, and his siblings are scattered throughout the kingdom like seeds on barren soil. Few legitimate claims to the once desperately sought Iron Throne still exist—or they are held in hands too weak or too distant to wield them effectively. The war, which raged out of control for so long, has burned itself out. But as in the aftermath of any climactic struggle, it is not long before the survivors, outlaws, renegades, and carrion eaters start to gather, picking over the bones of the dead and fighting for the spoils of the soon-to-be dead. Now in the Seven Kingdoms, as the human crows assemble over a banquet of ashes, daring new plots and dangerous new alliances are formed, while surprising faces—some familiar, others only just appearing—are seen emerging from an ominous twilight of past struggles and chaos to take up the challenges ahead. It is a time when the wise and the ambitious, the deceitful and the strong will acquire the skills, the power, and the magic to survive the stark and terrible times that lie before them. It is a time for nobles and commoners, soldiers and sorcerers, assassins and sages to come together and stake their fortunes . . . and their lives. For at a feast for crows, many are the guests—but only a few are the survivors.', 33.63, 77);

It is intended for use at the introductory graduate level. A distinguishing feature of the book is its integration of specialrelativity into teaching of classical mechanics. After a thorough review of the traditional theory, Part II of the book introduces extended Lagrangian and Hamiltonian methods that treat time as a transformable coordinate rather than the fixed parameter of Newtonian physics. Advanced topics such ascovariant Langrangians and Hamiltonians, canonical transformations, and Hamilton-Jacobi methods are simplified by the use of this extended theory. And the definition of canonical transformation no longer excludes the Lorenz transformation of special relativity.This is also a book for those who study analytical mechanics to prepare for a critical exploration of quantum mechanics. Comparisons to quantum mechanics appear throughout the text. The extended Hamiltonian theory with time as a coordinate is compared to Dirac''s formalism of primary phase spaceconstraints. The chapter on relativistic mechanics shows how to use covariant Hamiltonian theory to write the Klein-Gordon and Dirac equations. The chapter on Hamilton-Jacobi theory includes a discussion of the closely related Bohm hidden variable model of quantum mechanics.Classical mechanics itself is presented with an emphasis on methods, such as linear vector operators and dyadics, which will familiarize the student with similar techniques in quantum theory. Several of the current fundamental problems in theoretical physics - the development of quantum informationtechnology, and the problem of quantizing the gravitational field, to name two - require a rethinking of the quantum-classical connection.

Although the novel was a commercial failure and out of print at the time of the author''s death in 1891, its reputation grew immensely during the twentieth century. D. H. Lawrence called it "one of the strangest and most wonderful books in the world," and "the greatest book of the sea ever written." Moby-Dick is considered a Great American Novel and an outstanding work of the Romantic period in America and the American Renaissance. "Call me Ishmael" is one of world literature''s most famous opening sentences. The product of a year and a half of writing, the book is dedicated to Nathaniel Hawthorne, "in token of my admiration for his genius," and draws on Melville''s experience at sea, on his reading in whaling literature, and on literary inspirations such as Shakespeare and the Bible. The detailed and realistic descriptions of whale hunting and of extracting whale oil, as well as life aboard ship among a culturally diverse crew, are mixed with exploration of class and social status, good and evil, and the existence of God. In addition to narrative prose, Melville uses styles and literary devices ranging from songs, poetry and catalogs to Shakespearean stage directions, soliloquies and asides. The author changed the title at the very last moment in September 1851. The work first appeared as The Whale in London in October 1851, and then under its definitive title Moby-Dick in New York in November. The whale, however, appears in both the London and New York editions as "Moby Dick," with no hyphen. The British edition of five hundred copies was not reprinted during the author''s life, the American of almost three thousand was reprinted three times at approximately 250 copies, the last reprinting in 1871.

And, indeed, it seems as though that dream is destined to come to pass — because one day, under sudden and enigmatic circumstances, he finds himself in possession of "great expectations." In telling Pip''s story, Dickens traces a boy''s path from a hardscrabble rural life to the teeming streets of 19th-century London, unfolding a gripping tale of crime and guilt, revenge and reward, and love and loss. Its compelling characters include Magwitch, the fearful and fearsome convict; Estella, whose beauty is excelled only by her haughtiness; and the embittered Miss Havisham, an eccentric jilted bride.Written in the last decade of Dickens'' life, Great Expectations was praised widely and universally admired. It was his last great novel, and many critics believe it to be his finest. Readers and critics alike praised it for its masterful plot, which rises above the melodrama of some of his earlier works, and for its three-dimensional, psychologically realistic characters — characters much deeper and more interesting than the one-note caricatures of earlier novels. "In none of his other works," wrote the reviewer in the 1861 Atlantic, "does he evince a shrewder insight into real life, and a cheaper perception and knowledge of what is called the world." To Swinburne, the novel was unparalleled in all of English fiction, with defects "as nearly imperceptible as spots on the sun or shadows on a sunlit sea." Shaw found it Dickens'' "most completely perfect book."

The authors take great care to meet both these objectives, because this organization will allow instructors teaching from this text to stay on task so that each topic can be covered with the depth required before progressing to the next logical one. As a result the reader is prepared for each new unit and there is no need to repeat a concept in a subsequent chapter when it is utilized. This text is geared towards an introductory linear algebra course taken by first or second year undergraduate students. However, it offers the opportunity to introduce the importance of abstraction, not only in mathematics, but in many other areas where Linear Algebra is used. The textbooks approach is to take advantage of this opportunity by presenting abstract vector spaces as early as possible. Throughout the text, the authors are mindful of the difficulties that students at this level have with abstraction and introduce new conceptsfirst through examples which gently illustrate the idea. To motivate the definition of an abstract vector space, and the subtle concept of linear independence, the authors use addition and scalar multiplication of vectors in Euclidean Space. The authors have strived to create a balance between computation, problem solving, and abstraction. This approach equips students with the necessary skills and problem solving strategies in an abstract setting that allows for a greater understanding and appreciation for the numerous applications of the subject.', 57.45, NULL);

After examining the logical structure of propositions and the nature of logical inference, he discusses the theory of knowledge as well as principles of physics and ethics and aspects of the mystical.Supervised by the author himself, this translation from the German by C.

When the Voice took over her mother and commanded Hazel to use her "gift" for an evil purpose, Hazel couldn''t say no. Now, because of her mistake, the future of the world is at risk. Frank is a klutz. His grandmother claims he is descended from ancient heroes and can be anything he wants to be, but he doesn''t see it. He doesn''t even know who his father is.

But the Society he faithfully served was built on lies. Darrow’s kind have been betrayed and denied by their elitist masters, the Golds—and their only path to liberation is revolution. And so Darrow sacrifices himself in the name of the greater good for which Eo, his true love and inspiration, laid down her own life. He becomes a Gold, infiltrating their privileged realm so that he can destroy it from within.   A lamb among wolves in a cruel world, Darrow finds friendship, respect, and even love—but also the wrath of powerful rivals.

Never Go Back is a novel of action-charged suspense starring “one of the best thriller characters at work today” (Newsweek).   Former military cop Jack Reacher makes it all the way from snowbound South Dakota to his destination in northeastern Virginia, near Washington, D.C.: the headquarters of his old unit, the 110th MP. The old stone building is the closest thing to a home he ever had.   Reacher is there to meet—in person—the new commanding officer, Major Susan Turner, so far just a warm, intriguing voice on the phone.   But it isn’t Turner behind the CO’s desk. And Reacher is hit with two pieces of shocking news, one with serious criminal consequences, and one too personal to even think about.   When threatened, you can run or fight.   Reacher fights, aiming to find Turner and clear his name, barely a step ahead of the army, and the FBI, and the D.C. Metro police, and four unidentified thugs.   Combining an intricate puzzle of a plot and an exciting chase for truth and justice, Lee Child puts Reacher through his paces—and makes him question who he is, what he’s done, and the very future of his untethered life on the open road.Praise for Never Go Back   “A breathless cross-country spree . . . some of the best, wiliest writing [Lee] Child has ever done . . .

There, Angel encounters Lucy Monroe, a hardened journalist, who knows far more about Phoenix’s water secrets than she admits, and Maria Villarosa, a young Texas migrant, who dreams of escaping north to those places where water still falls from the sky. As bodies begin to pile up and bullets start flying, the three find themselves pawns in a game far bigger, more corrupt, and dirtier than any of them could have imagined. With Phoenix teetering on the verge of collapse and time running out for Angel, Lucy, and Maria, their only hope for survival rests in one another’s hands.  But when water is more valuable than gold, alliances shift like sand, and the only truth in the desert is that someone will have to bleed if anyone hopes to drink.', 13.96, 10);

R. Martin, Junot Díaz, and Erin Morgenstern. The Magicians Quentin Coldwater is brilliant but miserable. A high school math genius, he’s secretly fascinated with a series of children’s fantasy novels set in a magical land called Fillory, and real life is disappointing by comparison. When Quentin is unexpectedly admitted to an elite, secret college of magic, it looks like his wildest dreams may have come true. But his newfound powers lead him down a rabbit hole of hedonism and disillusionment, and ultimately to the dark secret behind the story of Fillory. The land of his childhood fantasies turns out to be much darker and more dangerous than he ever could have imagined . . .The Magicians is one of the most daring and inventive works of literary fantasy in years. No one who has escaped into the worlds of Narnia and Harry Potter should miss this breathtaking return to the landscape of the imagination.The Magician KingQuentin Coldwater should be happy. He escaped a miserable Brooklyn childhood, matriculated at a secret college for magic, and graduated to discover that Fillory—a fictional utopia—was actually real. But even as a Fillorian king, Quentin finds little peace. His old restlessness returns, and he longs for the thrills a heroic quest can bring.Accompanied by his oldest friend, Julia, Quentin sets off—only to somehow wind up back in the real-world and not in Fillory, as they’d hoped. As the pair struggle to find their way back to their lost kingdom, Quentin is forced to rely on Julia’s illicitly learned sorcery as they face a sinister threat in a world very far from the beloved fantasy novels of their youth.The Magician''s LandQuentin Coldwater has lost everything. He has been cast out of Fillory, the secret magical world of his childhood dreams that he once ruled. With nothing left to lose he returns to where his story began, the Brakebills Preparatory College of Magic. But he can’t hide from his past, and it’s not long before it comes looking for him. Meanwhile, the magical barriers that keep Fillory safe are failing, and barbarians from the north have invaded. Eliot and Janet, the rulers of Fillory, embark on a final quest to save their beloved world, only to discover a situation far more complex—and far more dire—than anyone had envisioned.Along with Plum, a brilliant young magician with a dark secret of her own, Quentin sets out on a crooked path through a magical demimonde of gray magic and desperate characters. His new life takes him back to old haunts, like Antarctica and the Neitherlands, and old friends he thought were lost forever. The Magician’s Land is an intricate and fantastical thriller, and an epic of love and redemption that brings the Magicians trilogy to a magnificent conclusion, confirming it as one of the great achievements in modern fantasy.', 42.55, 16);

Zeus said gently, a statement more than a question, “there is another.” Tonrack nodded, there must be, he said, “Those we killed were undoubtedly magicians and adepts, but none of them had the power to erect those psychic barriers we met when coming down through the atmosphere.” He led them into the fighter and told them first to search the craft to make sure no-one had concealed themselves aboard, that done, he lay down on his bed, and told them, as soon as he had left his body, they were to leave the planet and maintain a safe orbit for two hours, if he had not returned by then, they were to call in the fleet, and turn the planet into charred rock. He held Tersova for a moment, reached out and briefly grasped the hands of both Zeus and Athena, then cast himself into a self-induced trance. He had to do this quickly. Because he was facing a deadly enemy, far stronger than those before, and he would try to get an advantage before Tonrack could get his bearings. Rather than waiting until he had become the usual replica of himself, he assumed the form of the Dragon. The only difference this time was, the dragon form he assumed was that of his mentor, and as he did so, he knew the Dragon was there with him. He literally leapt out of his body as the fighter lifted off and soared high into the atmosphere. He had been right, the mage had as much power as he had, and had been waiting for him. As he emerged a dark shape passed him. Had he been slower, he would have been dealt a devastating blow. The magician had also assumed the form of a dragon. A huge black beast with two massively muscled hind legs and its arms were its wings; the ends of each of its elongated fingers were vicious claws.

This edition collects all of the alternative endings together for the first time, along with early drafts of other essential passages, offering new insight into Hemingway’s craft and creative process and the evolution of one of the greatest novels of the twentieth century. Featuring Hemingway’s own 1948 introduction to an illustrated reissue of the novel, a personal foreword by the author’s son Patrick Hemingway, and a new introduction by the author’s grandson Seán Hemingway, this edition of A Farewell to Arms is truly a celebration.', 26.49, 188);

The proposed Reform Bill promises political change; the building of railroads alters both the physical and cultural landscape; new scientific approaches to medicine incite public division; and scandal lurks behind respectability. The quiet drama of ordinary lives and flawed choices are played out in the complexly portrayed central characters of the novel—the idealistic Dorothea Brooke; the ambitious Dr. Lydgate; the spendthrift Fred Vincy; and the steadfast Mary Garth. The appearance of two outsiders further disrupts the town’s equilibrium—Will Ladislaw, the spirited nephew of Dorothea’s husband, the Rev. Edward Casaubon, and the sinister John Raffles, who threatens to expose the hidden past of one of the town’s elite. Middlemarch displays George Eliot’s clear-eyed yet humane understanding of characters caught up in the mysterious unfolding of self-knowledge. This Penguin Classics edition uses the second edition of 1874 and features an introduction and notes by Eliot-biographer Rosemary Ashton. In her introduction, Ashton discusses themes of social change in Middlemarch, and examines the novel as an imaginative embodiment of Eliot''s humanist beliefs.For more than sixty-five years, Penguin has been the leading publisher of classic literature in the English-speaking world.

Much of the work deals with ideas such as the "eternal recurrence of the same," the parable on the "death of God," and the "prophecy" of the Übermensch, which were first introduced in The Gay Science.The book chronicles the fictitious travels and speeches of Zarathustra. Zarathustra''s namesake was the founder of Zoroastrianism, usually known in English as Zoroaster (Avestan: Zaraϑustra). Nietzsche is clearly portraying a "new" or "different" Zarathustra, one who turns traditional morality on its head.Zarathustra has a simple characterization and plot, narrated sporadically throughout the text. It possesses a unique experimental style, one that is, for instance, evident in newly invented "dithyrambs" narrated or sung by Zarathustra. Likewise, the separate Dithyrambs of Dionysus was written in autumn 1888, and printed with the full volume in 1892, as the corollaries of Zarathustra''s "abundance."Some speculate that Nietzsche intended to write about final acts of creation and destruction brought about by Zarathustra. However, the book lacks a finale to match that description; its actual ending focuses more on Zarathustra recognizing that his legacy is beginning to perpetuate, and consequently choosing to leave the higher men to their own devices in carrying his legacy forth.', 9.08, NULL);

Russell discusses various aspects of socialist-communist and syndicalist thought, and applies them to the various portions of civil society.

Although Russell believes that the socialist system would be the closest to perfection, he does not believe that it would be entirely lacking of flaws. Furthermore, Russell attributes many problems of the theory as solvable over time; a fine-tuning of the technical implementation of socialist economics would, so the author proposes, iron out the problems and inefficiencies in the system.  A lifelong socialist, Russell believed that the correct implementation of left-wing theory could result in the greatest possible amount of happiness and prosperity among a given country''s citizens.

Yet growing up in an artificial community of young soldiers Ender suffers greatly from isolation, rivalry from his peers, pressure from the adult teachers, and an unsettling fear of the alien invaders. His psychological battles include loneliness, fear that he is becoming like the cruel brother he remembers, and fanning the flames of devotion to his beloved sister. Is Ender the general Earth needs?

G. Wells first published “The Invisible Man” in 1897, the title alone ensured its success. Invisibility fascinates, attracts, and terrifies. It’s allure rests in the ability to escape notice (and with it criticism, self-consciousness, and the power of the other’s gaze), to be freed from social pressures (to be pretty, dress well, be polite, stay put, etc.), and to have the freedom to enter any unlocked space without challenge. An invisible person can eavesdrop and learn new information, can quietly monitor the behavior of loved ones, and can behave the way they want to without fear of attracting immediate notice. There is a liberating feeling behind this attraction: a longing to escape criticism and evade disapproval. Who disapproves of the table manners, posture, or fashion choices of an invisible man? The fantasy lies in the ability to be unshackled from the weight of self-consciousness, and levitated out of our own shame and embarrassment by proxy. Since its publication, “The Invisible Man” has offered a fascinating glimpse into the psychology of a sociopath, and the overwhelming power of rage. At its simplest it is an engrossing example of science fiction that envisions the frightening possibilities of technology: to simultaneously become all powerful and utterly vulnerable (something we understand all too well in the Digital Age). At its most complex it is a potent parable of social Darwinism reversed: the high-flying genius whose arrogance, egotism, and misanthropy leave him flung so far from the reach of his fellow man that he is devoured by his own narcissism. It is a lesson in pride as much as it is a fantasy of possibilities – a study in self-control as much as it is a dream of self-potential. Invisibility continues to fascinate us: the ability to blend in and avoid criticism is impossibly attractive. But we know all too well the horror that it can bring: the paranoia of observation, the vulnerability of voyeurism, and the insecurity of exposure. But perhaps it is the Invisible Man himself who experiences the ultimate human horror – anonymity – an idea that begins to dawn on him as he finds himself friendless, fatherless, and reviled by every person he encounters. Ultimately this is the terror of an invisible man, regardless of the perspective: to enter unnoticed, to see unseen, to be missing but unmissed.', 19.76, NULL);

Specifically, he accuses them of founding grand metaphysical systems upon the faith that the good man is the opposite of the evil man, rather than just a different expression of the same basic impulses that find more direct expression in the evil man. The work moves into the realm "beyond good and evil" in the sense of leaving behind the traditional morality which Nietzsche subjects to a destructive critique in favour of what he regards as an affirmative approach that fearlessly confronts the perspectival nature of knowledge and the perilous condition of the modern individual.', 8.0, NULL);

My first campaign involved the invasion of a mineral-rich planet called Cancri-9, better known as Steel World. The attack didn’t go well, and now Earth has entered a grim struggle for survival.

Three generations of its warriors have gone off to war, held the line against the larger, more powerful enemy. Now the fourth conflict is imminent, and the Confederation’s navy is on alert, positioned behind the frontier, waiting for the attack it knows is coming. The battleship Dauntless has spent the past ten months patrolling the border, deployed far forward of the main fleet, a forlorn hope, an advance guard positioned to give the warning of invasion. But no attack has come. Her crew is exhausted, and the aging battleship needs maintenance. With the fleet mobilized and the forward bases overloaded beyond capacity, she is sent clear across the Confederation, to a planet along the quiet and peaceful far frontier. Her crew is looking forward to a rest, and Dauntless herself is scheduled for a long-overdue maintenance session. But the quiet frontier isn’t what it seems…and when a distress call is received from one of the mining colonies on the edge of Confederation space, it falls to Captain Tyler Barron to take Dauntless forward, to find out what is happening, and to put a stop to it. Barron and his crew have their ship—and each other—but they can expect no other help. Suspicion is strong that Union deceit is at play, that the attack is some sort of diversion, intended to draw Confederation forces from the disputed border. The orders are clear. No ships will be transferred from the prospective battle line. Stopping whatever is happening on the rim is Barron’s responsibility, and his alone. Barron is the grandson of the Confederation’s great hero, the father of the modern navy. His family name has always carried privilege with it, and crushing responsibility.

When she refuses to conduct the discreet affair that her cold, ambitious husband (and Russian high society) would condone, she is doomed. Set against the tragic love of Anna and Vronsky, the plight of the melancholy nobleman Konstantine Levin unfolds.  In doubt about the meaning of life, haunted by thoughts of suicide, Levin’s struggles echo Tolstoy’s own spiritual crisis.  But Anna''s inner turmoil mirrors the own emotional imprisonment and mental disintegration of a woman who dares to transgress the strictures of a patriarchal world.  In Anna Karenina, Leo Tolstoy brought to perfection the novel of social realism and created a masterpiece that bared the Russian soul.');

The Apology (not a dialogue), Crito, Euthyphro, and the unforgettable Phaedo relate the trial and death of Socrates and propound the immortality of the soul. In the famous Symposium and Phaedrus, written when Socrates was still alive, we find the origin and meaning of love. Cratylus discusses the nature of language. The great masterpiece in ten books, the Republic, concerns righteousness (and involves education, equality of the sexes, the structure of society, and abolition of slavery). Of the six so-called dialectical dialogues Euthydemus deals with philosophy; metaphysical Parmenides is about general concepts and absolute being; Theaetetus reasons about the theory of knowledge. Of its sequels, Sophist deals with not-being; Politicus with good and bad statesmanship and governments; Philebus with what is good. The Timaeus seeks the origin of the visible universe out of abstract geometrical elements. The unfinished Critias treats of lost Atlantis.

In Memoirs of a Geisha, we enter a world where appearances are paramount; where a girl''s virginity is auctioned to the highest bidder; where women are trained to beguile the most powerful men; and where love, always elusive, is scorned as illusion.  Sayuri''s story begins in a poor fishing village in 1929, when, as a nine-year-old with unusual blue-gray eyes, she is taken from her home and sold into slavery to a renowned geisha house. Through her eyes, we see the decadent heart of Gion--the geisha district of Kyoto--with its marvelous teahouses and theaters, narrow back alleys, ornate temples, and artists'' streets. And we witness her transformation as she learns the rigorous arts of the geisha: dance and music; wearing kimono, elaborate makeup and hair; pouring sake to reveal just a touch of inner wrist; competing with a jealous rival for men''s solicitude and the money that goes with it. But as World War II erupts and the geisha houses are forced to close, Sayuri, with little money and even less food, must reinvent herself all over again to find a rare kind of freedom on her own terms.Memoirs of a Geisha is a book of nuances and vivid metaphor, of memorable characters rendered with humor and pathos. And though the story is rich with detail and a vast knowledge of history, it is the transparent, seductive voice of Sayuri that the reader remembers. A dazzling literary achievement of empathy and grace by an extraordinary new writer.');

After centuries of bitter strife and fatal treachery, the seven powers dividing the land have decimated one another into an uneasy truce. Or so it appears. . . . With the death of the monstrous King Joffrey, Cersei is ruling as regent in King’s Landing. Robb Stark’s demise has broken the back of the Northern rebels, and his siblings are scattered throughout the kingdom like seeds on barren soil. Few legitimate claims to the once desperately sought Iron Throne still exist—or they are held in hands too weak or too distant to wield them effectively. The war, which raged out of control for so long, has burned itself out.

So together Hazel and Fiver and a few other brave rabbits secretly leave behind the safety and strictures of the warren and hop tentatively out into a vast and strange world. Chased by their former friends, hunted by dogs and foxes, avoiding farms and other human threats, but making new friends, Hazel and his fellow rabbits dream of a new life in the emerald embrace of Watership Down . . .

Aldous Huxley''s profoundly important classic of world literature, Brave New World is a searching vision of an unequal, technologically-advanced future where humans are genetically bred, socially indoctrinated, and pharmaceutically anesthetized to passively uphold an authoritarian ruling order whose motto is "Community, Identity, Stability."—all at the cost of our freedom, humanity, and perhaps our souls. "A genius [who] who spent his life decrying the onward march of the Machine" (The New Yorker), Huxley was a man of incomparable talents: equally an artist, a spiritual seeker, and one of history''s keenest observers of human nature and civilization. Brave New World, his masterpiece, has enthralled and terrified millions of readers, and retains its urgent relevance to this day as both a warning as we head into tomorrow and as a thought-provoking, satisfying work of literature.

It is intended for use at the introductory graduate level. A distinguishing feature of the book is its integration of specialrelativity into teaching of classical mechanics. After a thorough review of the traditional theory, Part II of the book introduces extended Lagrangian and Hamiltonian methods that treat time as a transformable coordinate rather than the fixed parameter of Newtonian physics. Advanced topics such ascovariant Langrangians and Hamiltonians, canonical transformations, and Hamilton-Jacobi methods are simplified by the use of this extended theory. And the definition of canonical transformation no longer excludes the Lorenz transformation of special relativity.This is also a book for those who study analytical mechanics to prepare for a critical exploration of quantum mechanics. Comparisons to quantum mechanics appear throughout the text. The extended Hamiltonian theory with time as a coordinate is compared to Dirac''s formalism of primary phase spaceconstraints. The chapter on relativistic mechanics shows how to use covariant Hamiltonian theory to write the Klein-Gordon and Dirac equations. The chapter on Hamilton-Jacobi theory includes a discussion of the closely related Bohm hidden variable model of quantum mechanics.Classical mechanics itself is presented with an emphasis on methods, such as linear vector operators and dyadics, which will familiarize the student with similar techniques in quantum theory. Several of the current fundamental problems in theoretical physics - the development of quantum informationtechnology, and the problem of quantizing the gravitational field, to name two - require a rethinking of the quantum-classical connection.

Although the novel was a commercial failure and out of print at the time of the author''s death in 1891, its reputation grew immensely during the twentieth century. D. H. Lawrence called it "one of the strangest and most wonderful books in the world," and "the greatest book of the sea ever written." Moby-Dick is considered a Great American Novel and an outstanding work of the Romantic period in America and the American Renaissance. "Call me Ishmael" is one of world literature''s most famous opening sentences. The product of a year and a half of writing, the book is dedicated to Nathaniel Hawthorne, "in token of my admiration for his genius," and draws on Melville''s experience at sea, on his reading in whaling literature, and on literary inspirations such as Shakespeare and the Bible. The detailed and realistic descriptions of whale hunting and of extracting whale oil, as well as life aboard ship among a culturally diverse crew, are mixed with exploration of class and social status, good and evil, and the existence of God. In addition to narrative prose, Melville uses styles and literary devices ranging from songs, poetry and catalogs to Shakespearean stage directions, soliloquies and asides.

And, indeed, it seems as though that dream is destined to come to pass — because one day, under sudden and enigmatic circumstances, he finds himself in possession of "great expectations." In telling Pip''s story, Dickens traces a boy''s path from a hardscrabble rural life to the teeming streets of 19th-century London, unfolding a gripping tale of crime and guilt, revenge and reward, and love and loss. Its compelling characters include Magwitch, the fearful and fearsome convict; Estella, whose beauty is excelled only by her haughtiness; and the embittered Miss Havisham, an eccentric jilted bride.Written in the last decade of Dickens'' life, Great Expectations was praised widely and universally admired. It was his last great novel, and many critics believe it to be his finest. Readers and critics alike praised it for its masterful plot, which rises above the melodrama of some of his earlier works, and for its three-dimensional, psychologically realistic characters — characters much deeper and more interesting than the one-note caricatures of earlier novels. "In none of his other works," wrote the reviewer in the 1861 Atlantic, "does he evince a shrewder insight into real life, and a cheaper perception and knowledge of what is called the world." To Swinburne, the novel was unparalleled in all of English fiction, with defects "as nearly imperceptible as spots on the sun or shadows on a sunlit sea." Shaw found it Dickens'' "most completely perfect book." Now this inexpensive edition invites modern readers to savor this timeless masterpiece, teeming with colorful characters, unexpected plot twists, and Dickens'' vivid rendering of the vast tapestry of mid-Victorian England.');

Now Robert is riding north to Winterfell, bringing his queen, the lovely but cold Cersei, his son, the cruel, vainglorious Prince Joffrey, and the queen’s brothers Jaime and Tyrion of the powerful and wealthy House Lannister—the first a swordsman without equal, the second a dwarf whose stunted stature belies a brilliant mind. All are heading for Winterfell and a fateful encounter that will change the course of kingdoms.   Meanwhile, across the Narrow Sea, Prince Viserys, heir of the fallen House Targaryen, which once ruled all of Westeros, schemes to reclaim the throne with an army of barbarian Dothraki—whose loyalty he will purchase in the only coin left to him: his beautiful yet innocent sister, Daenerys.   “Long live George Martin . . . a literary dervish, enthralled by complicated characters and vivid language, and bursting with the wild vision of the very best tale tellers.”—The New York Times');

The organization of this textis motivated by the authors'' experience which tells them what essential concepts should be mastered by students in a one semester undergraduate Linear Algebra course.The authors'' main objectives are to fully develop each topic before moving on and to connect topics naturally. The authors take great care to meet both these objectives, because this organization will allow instructors teaching from this text to stay on task so that each topic can be covered with the depth required before progressing to the next logical one. As a result the reader is prepared for each new unit and there is no need to repeat a concept in a subsequent chapter when it is utilized. This text is geared towards an introductory linear algebra course taken by first or second year undergraduate students. However, it offers the opportunity to introduce the importance of abstraction, not only in mathematics, but in many other areas where Linear Algebra is used. The textbooks approach is to take advantage of this opportunity by presenting abstract vector spaces as early as possible. Throughout the text, the authors are mindful of the difficulties that students at this level have with abstraction and introduce new conceptsfirst through examples which gently illustrate the idea. To motivate the definition of an abstract vector space, and the subtle concept of linear independence, the authors use addition and scalar multiplication of vectors in Euclidean Space. The authors have strived to create a balance between computation, problem solving, and abstraction. This approach equips students with the necessary skills and problem solving strategies in an abstract setting that allows for a greater understanding and appreciation for the numerous applications of the subject.');

In proclaiming philosophy as a matter of logic rather than of metaphysics, Wittgenstein created a sensation among intellectual circles that influenced the development of logical positivism and changed the direction of 20th-century thought.Beginning with the principles of symbolism and the necessary relations between words and objects, the author applies his theories to various branches of traditional philosophy, illustrating how mistakes arise from inappropriate use of symbolism and misuses of language. After examining the logical structure of propositions and the nature of logical inference, he discusses the theory of knowledge as well as principles of physics and ethics and aspects of the mystical.Supervised by the author himself, this translation from the German by C. K. Ogden is regarded as the definitive text. A magisterial introduction by the distinguished philosopher Bertrand Russell hails Wittgenstein''s achievement as extraordinarily important, "one which no serious philosopher can afford to neglect."

Teaching cognitive science is difficult, Thagard observes, because students come to this multidisciplinary subject with widely different competencies, backgrounds, and interests. Mind solves this dilemma by making logic comprehensible to psychology students, computer algorithms comprehensible to English students, and philosophical controversies comprehensible to computer science students.

The leader of a fanatical cult, obsessed with traveling beyond the reaches of known space, is bent on opening a cosmic gateway using dreaded dark matter as the key—risking a cataclysmic reaction that will consume the entire star system. But more shocking to Lanoree than even the prospect of total galactic annihilation, is the decision of her Je’daii Masters to task her with the mission of preventing it.

He manages to spin a tale that feels like Star Wars, but also feels different from other stories that have been told before. While there is some threat of system wide destruction, the point is never pushed to being ridiculous. The characters feel believable and provoke interest. The attention to the characters never takes away from the plot. There’s also a remarkable balance between world building, plot and character development, and action.

Though the road ahead is fraught with danger and deceit, Darrow must choose to follow Eo’s principles of love and justice to free his people.   He must live for more.Praise for Golden Son  “Gripping . . . Both author and lead character have cranked up the emotional stakes. . . . With Golden Son, Brown avoids the sophomore slump, charging the novel with the kind of dystopia-toppling action you’d expect in a trilogy ender, not a middle volume. On virtually every level, this is a sequel that hates sequels—a perfect fit for a hero who already defies the tropes. [Grade:] A”—Entertainment Weekly  “Stirring . . . Comparisons to The Hunger Games and Game of Thrones series are inevitable, for this tale has elements of both.”—Kirkus Reviews“Brown writes layered, flawed characters . . . but plot is his most breathtaking strength. . . . Every action seems to flow into the next.”—NPR“It’s a far superior sequel, in fact: one of the rare breed of reads that improves upon its predecessor in every conceivable category. . . . In a word, Golden Son is stunning. Never mind how little we’ve seen of 2015: Among science fiction fans, it should be a shoo-in for book of the year.”—Tordotcom “The stakes are even higher than they were in Red Rising, and the twists and turns of the story are every bit as exciting. The jaw-dropper of an ending will leave readers hungry for the conclusion to Brown’s wholly original, completely thrilling saga.”—Booklist (starred review)    “Dramatic . . . the rare middle book that loses almost no momentum as it sets up the final installment.”—Publishers Weekly');

Now in his middle years, Dodge appreciates his comfortable, unencumbered life, managing his myriad business interests, and spending time with his beloved niece Zula and her young daughter, Sophia. One beautiful autumn day, while he undergoes a routine medical procedure, something goes irrevocably wrong. Dodge is pronounced brain dead and put on life support, leaving his stunned family and close friends with difficult decisions. Long ago, when a much younger Dodge drew up his will, he directed that his body be given to a cryonics company now owned by enigmatic tech entrepreneur Elmo Shepherd. Legally bound to follow the directive despite their misgivings, Dodge’s family has his brain scanned and its data structures uploaded and stored in the cloud, until it can eventually be revived. In the coming years, technology allows Dodge’s brain to be turned back on. It is an achievement that is nothing less than the disruption of death itself.

As Tom Dugan and Alex Kairouz, his partner and best friend, struggle to ransom their ship and crew from murderous Somali pirates, things take a turn for the worse. A US Navy contracted tanker with a full load of jet fuel is also hijacked, not by garden variety pirates, but by terrorists with links to Al Qaeda, changing the playing field completely. With a possible link between piracy and terrorism now in play, the US and British goverments order the halt of all negotiations for captive ships, and enraged pirates ratchet up the mistreatment of the captive crews. When one of their crewman is murdered in front of him on a live video feed, a frustrated Dugan takes matters into his own hands and starts his own rescue operation, only to stumble across something far more sinister — a rogue salvage operation for a long lost weapon of mass destruction. Isolated at sea on an old tanker previously destined for the ship breakers, Dugan and his hastily assembled little force of Russian mercenaries find themselves the last line of defense between the world and a terrifying bio-weapon.

The old stone building is the closest thing to a home he ever had.   Reacher is there to meet—in person—the new commanding officer, Major Susan Turner, so far just a warm, intriguing voice on the phone.   But it isn’t Turner behind the CO’s desk.

Dodge is pronounced brain dead and put on life support, leaving his stunned family and close friends with difficult decisions. Long ago, when a much younger Dodge drew up his will, he directed that his body be given to a cryonics company now owned by enigmatic tech entrepreneur Elmo Shepherd. Legally bound to follow the directive despite their misgivings, Dodge’s family has his brain scanned and its data structures uploaded and stored in the cloud, until it can eventually be revived. In the coming years, technology allows Dodge’s brain to be turned back on. It is an achievement that is nothing less than the disruption of death itself. An eternal afterlife—the Bitworld—is created, in which humans continue to exist as digital souls. But this brave new immortal world is not the Utopia it might first seem . . . Fall, or Dodge in Hell is pure, unadulterated fun: a grand drama of analog and digital, man and machine, angels and demons, gods and followers, the finite and the eternal. In this exhilarating epic, Neal Stephenson raises profound existential questions and touches on the revolutionary breakthroughs that are transforming our future. Combining the technological, philosophical, and spiritual in one grand myth, he delivers a mind-blowing speculative literary saga for the modern age.');

Just rich enough to move out of her coffin-sized apartment and eat something better than flavored algae. Rich enough to pay off a debt she’s owed for a long time.   So when a chance at a huge score finally comes her way, Jazz can’t say no. Sure, it requires her to graduate from small-time smuggler to full-on criminal mastermind. And it calls for a particular combination of cunning, technical skills, and large explosions—not to mention sheer brazen swagger. But Jazz has never run into a challenge her intellect can’t handle, and she figures she’s got the ‘swagger’ part down.    The trouble is, engineering the perfect crime is just the start of Jazz’s problems. Because her little heist is about to land her in the middle of a conspiracy for control of Artemis itself.    Trapped between competing forces, pursued by a killer and the law alike, even Jazz has to admit she’s in way over her head. She’ll have to hatch a truly spectacular scheme to have a chance at staying alive and saving her city.    Jazz is no hero, but she is a very good criminal.    That’ll have to do.    Propelled by its heroine’s wisecracking voice, set in a city that’s at once stunningly imagined and intimately familiar, and brimming over with clever problem-solving and heist-y fun, Artemis is another irresistible brew of science, suspense, and humor from #1 bestselling author Andy Weir.');

Former great civilizations had become extinct, but aware of the fate which lay before them had reached out, leaving Time Capsules for a new race to find, designed to help them in the development. The new race of people, because of their retained affinity with the sea called themselves the Waterborn. Highly intelligent and with telepathic powers the Time Capsules did accelerate the growth and the building of their civilization. Another civilization was taking an interest in the Waterborn, not from Earth but this was the most highly developed race in the Universe. It was not the first time they had visited Earth, leader of their early society known as the Immortals had lived on Earth thousands of years before and were known as the Gods. With the support of a space traveling civilization millions of years old, the Waterborn thrived, eventually becoming space travelers as well. Hundreds of years later, the Empire received a call from Earth. Planet Earth was destroying itself from within. The entire civilization was rescued and resettled on a planet which had just gone through catastrophic events which had wiped out more than half of their population. From these chaotic beginnings the Waterborn matured as a civilization and began taking vital roles in the Greater Empire. Call of a Dragon follows members of this remarkable race and their colleagues in their adventures and dedication to the protection and expansion of the Empire. As they face diabolical threats and fight powers from the Dark Side, they find help from unlikely sources. Against tremendous odds those of the Waterborn Saga help to shape the Universe of the future. Excerpt Tonrack activated the remote which brought the fighter to them and they were about to board, when he stopped them. Zeus said gently, a statement more than a question, “there is another.” Tonrack nodded, there must be, he said, “Those we killed were undoubtedly magicians and adepts, but none of them had the power to erect those psychic barriers we met when coming down through the atmosphere.” He led them into the fighter and told them first to search the craft to make sure no-one had concealed themselves aboard, that done, he lay down on his bed, and told them, as soon as he had left his body, they were to leave the planet and maintain a safe orbit for two hours, if he had not returned by then, they were to call in the fleet, and turn the planet into charred rock. He held Tersova for a moment, reached out and briefly grasped the hands of both Zeus and Athena, then cast himself into a self-induced trance. He had to do this quickly. Because he was facing a deadly enemy, far stronger than those before, and he would try to get an advantage before Tonrack could get his bearings. Rather than waiting until he had become the usual replica of himself, he assumed the form of the Dragon. The only difference this time was, the dragon form he assumed was that of his mentor, and as he did so, he knew the Dragon was there with him. He literally leapt out of his body as the fighter lifted off and soared high into the atmosphere. He had been right, the mage had as much power as he had, and had been waiting for him. As he emerged a dark shape passed him. Had he been slower, he would have been dealt a devastating blow. The magician had also assumed the form of a dragon. A huge black beast with two massively muscled hind legs and its arms were its wings; the ends of each of its elongated fingers were vicious claws. The speed of his exit, not only protected him, it also put him above his foe. This dragon was an ice dragon, and its icy breath could neutralize his fire.

Much of the work deals with ideas such as the "eternal recurrence of the same," the parable on the "death of God," and the "prophecy" of the Übermensch, which were first introduced in The Gay Science.The book chronicles the fictitious travels and speeches of Zarathustra. Zarathustra''s namesake was the founder of Zoroastrianism, usually known in English as Zoroaster (Avestan: Zaraϑustra). Nietzsche is clearly portraying a "new" or "different" Zarathustra, one who turns traditional morality on its head.Zarathustra has a simple characterization and plot, narrated sporadically throughout the text. It possesses a unique experimental style, one that is, for instance, evident in newly invented "dithyrambs" narrated or sung by Zarathustra. Likewise, the separate Dithyrambs of Dionysus was written in autumn 1888, and printed with the full volume in 1892, as the corollaries of Zarathustra''s "abundance."Some speculate that Nietzsche intended to write about final acts of creation and destruction brought about by Zarathustra. However, the book lacks a finale to match that description; its actual ending focuses more on Zarathustra recognizing that his legacy is beginning to perpetuate, and consequently choosing to leave the higher men to their own devices in carrying his legacy forth.');

The genius of such thinkers and makers—the kind of genius that had emerged in ancient Greece—this alone was the touchstone for true understanding.

Russell discusses various aspects of socialist-communist and syndicalist thought, and applies them to the various portions of civil society. Beginning with an examination of the history of the political theories and their potential for success, Russell proposes a sort of ''guild socialism'' whereby workers are organized into different groupings and specialisms, as opposed to the centralized, bureaucratic system advocated by state socialism.  Although Russell believes that the socialist system would be the closest to perfection, he does not believe that it would be entirely lacking of flaws. Furthermore, Russell attributes many problems of the theory as solvable over time; a fine-tuning of the technical implementation of socialist economics would, so the author proposes, iron out the problems and inefficiencies in the system.  A lifelong socialist, Russell believed that the correct implementation of left-wing theory could result in the greatest possible amount of happiness and prosperity among a given country''s citizens. The author defined freedom as economic and social enfranchisement shared equitably among the workers of society and posits that this, together with well-funded practice of the arts and sciences, was the optimum way for humans to be organized.');

Yet growing up in an artificial community of young soldiers Ender suffers greatly from isolation, rivalry from his peers, pressure from the adult teachers, and an unsettling fear of the alien invaders.

Wells first published “The Invisible Man” in 1897, the title alone ensured its success. Invisibility fascinates, attracts, and terrifies. It’s allure rests in the ability to escape notice (and with it criticism, self-consciousness, and the power of the other’s gaze), to be freed from social pressures (to be pretty, dress well, be polite, stay put, etc.), and to have the freedom to enter any unlocked space without challenge. An invisible person can eavesdrop and learn new information, can quietly monitor the behavior of loved ones, and can behave the way they want to without fear of attracting immediate notice. There is a liberating feeling behind this attraction: a longing to escape criticism and evade disapproval. Who disapproves of the table manners, posture, or fashion choices of an invisible man? The fantasy lies in the ability to be unshackled from the weight of self-consciousness, and levitated out of our own shame and embarrassment by proxy. Since its publication, “The Invisible Man” has offered a fascinating glimpse into the psychology of a sociopath, and the overwhelming power of rage. At its simplest it is an engrossing example of science fiction that envisions the frightening possibilities of technology: to simultaneously become all powerful and utterly vulnerable (something we understand all too well in the Digital Age). At its most complex it is a potent parable of social Darwinism reversed: the high-flying genius whose arrogance, egotism, and misanthropy leave him flung so far from the reach of his fellow man that he is devoured by his own narcissism. It is a lesson in pride as much as it is a fantasy of possibilities – a study in self-control as much as it is a dream of self-potential. Invisibility continues to fascinate us: the ability to blend in and avoid criticism is impossibly attractive. But we know all too well the horror that it can bring: the paranoia of observation, the vulnerability of voyeurism, and the insecurity of exposure. But perhaps it is the Invisible Man himself who experiences the ultimate human horror – anonymity – an idea that begins to dawn on him as he finds himself friendless, fatherless, and reviled by every person he encounters. Ultimately this is the terror of an invisible man, regardless of the perspective: to enter unnoticed, to see unseen, to be missing but unmissed.');

Specifically, he accuses them of founding grand metaphysical systems upon the faith that the good man is the opposite of the evil man, rather than just a different expression of the same basic impulses that find more direct expression in the evil man. The work moves into the realm "beyond good and evil" in the sense of leaving behind the traditional morality which Nietzsche subjects to a destructive critique in favour of what he regards as an affirmative approach that fearlessly confronts the perspectival nature of knowledge and the perilous condition of the modern individual.');

Many are called upon to rid the galaxy of lingering navigation data that could potentially reveal the location of Earth and ensure the destruction of humanity.

As the Covenant continues to glass the human-occupied planets near Hesiod, many of the survivors, aided by a stronghold of human insurrectionists, are fleeing to the asteroids for refuge. They have transformed the tumbling satellites into a tenuous yet ingenious settlement known as the Rubble—and have come face-to-face with a Covenant settlement of Kig-Yar…yet somehow survived.

Luckily for the UNSC, this uneasy alliance is in the path of the Spartan Gray Team, a three-person renegade squad whose simple task is to wreak havoc from behind enemy lines in any way they see fit.

He can heal hearts as well as bones, he build a house, he can calm the waters or blow up a storm. And he can teach his knack to others, to the measure of their own talent.Alvin has been trying to avert the terrible war that his wife, Peggy, a torch of extraordinary power, has seen down the life-lines of every American. Now she has sent him down the Mizzippy to the city of New Orleans, or Nueva Barcelona as they call it under Spanish occupation.

Now Alvin must take the first steps on the road to the Crystal City that was shown to him in a vision so long ago.');

Within hours, the FBI descends, laying claim to the victim without ever saying who he was or why he was there.   All Reacher wanted was a ride to Virginia. All he did was stick out his thumb. But he soon discovers he has hitched more than a ride. He has tied himself to a massive conspiracy that makes him a threat—to both sides at once.   In Lee Child’s white-hot thriller, nothing is what it seems, and nobody is telling the truth. As the tension rises, the twists come fast and furious, keeping readers guessing and gasping until the explosive finale.   Praise for #1 bestselling author Lee Child and his Reacher series   “Child is a superb craftsman of suspense.”—Entertainment Weekly   “The truth about Reacher gets better and better.”—Janet Maslin, The New York Times   “Implausible, irresistible Reacher remains just about the best butt-kicker in thriller-lit.”—Kirkus Reviews   “Like his hero Jack Reacher, Lee Child seems to make no wrong steps.”—Associated Press   “Lee Child [is] the current poster-boy of American crime fiction.”—Los Angeles Times   “Indisputably the best escape artist in this escapist genre.”—Marilyn Stasio, The New York Times   “Jack Reacher is much more like the heir to the Op and Marlowe than Spenser ever was.”—Esquire');

Jack Reacher hits the pavement and sticks out his thumb. He plans to follow the sun on an epic trip across America, from Maine to California. He doesn’t get far. On a country road deep in the New England woods, he sees a sign to a place he has never been: the town where his father was born. He thinks, What’s one extra day? He takes the detour. At the same moment, in the same isolated area, a car breaks down. Two young Canadians had been on their way to New York City to sell a treasure. Now they’re stranded at a lonely motel in the middle of nowhere. The owners seem almost too friendly. It’s a strange place, but it’s all there is. The next morning, in the city clerk’s office, Reacher asks about the old family home. He’s told no one named Reacher ever lived in town. He’s always known his father left and never returned, but now Reacher wonders, Was he ever there in the first place?  As Reacher explores his father’s life, and as the Canadians face lethal dangers, strands of different stories begin to merge. Then Reacher makes a shocking discovery: The present can be tough, but the past can be tense . . . and deadly.Praise for Past Tense “Child is one writer who should never be taken for granted.”—The New York Times Book Review “[Lee Child] shows no signs of slowing down. . . . Reacher is a man for whom the phrase moral compass was invented: His code determines his direction. . . . You need Jack Reacher.”—The Atlantic “Superb . . . Child neatly interweaves multiple narratives, ratchets up the suspense (the reveal of the motel plot is delicious), and delivers a powerful, satisfying denouement. Fans will enjoy learning more of this enduring character’s roots, and Child’s spare prose continues to set a very high bar.”—Publishers Weekly (boxed and starred review) “Another first-class entry in a series that continues to set the gold standard for aspiring thriller authors.”—Booklist (starred review) “With his usual flair for succinctness and eye for detail, Child creates another rollicking Reacher road trip that will please fans and newcomers alike.”—Library Journal (starred review)');

Three generations of its warriors have gone off to war, held the line against the larger, more powerful enemy. Now the fourth conflict is imminent, and the Confederation’s navy is on alert, positioned behind the frontier, waiting for the attack it knows is coming. The battleship Dauntless has spent the past ten months patrolling the border, deployed far forward of the main fleet, a forlorn hope, an advance guard positioned to give the warning of invasion. But no attack has come. Her crew is exhausted, and the aging battleship needs maintenance. With the fleet mobilized and the forward bases overloaded beyond capacity, she is sent clear across the Confederation, to a planet along the quiet and peaceful far frontier. Her crew is looking forward to a rest, and Dauntless herself is scheduled for a long-overdue maintenance session. But the quiet frontier isn’t what it seems…and when a distress call is received from one of the mining colonies on the edge of Confederation space, it falls to Captain Tyler Barron to take Dauntless forward, to find out what is happening, and to put a stop to it. Barron and his crew have their ship—and each other—but they can expect no other help.

And if you''re in college, hoping for a job in computing when you graduate, this book is for you too.  It''s an anarchic compendium  of the anarchic vocabulary, habits, and style of the programming  profession.The New Hacker''s Dictionary is mostly arranged as a set of  alphabetical entries, but there are a couple of excellent appendices, on  hacker folklore and on the hacker lifestyle and habits.  (Hacker is used  here in its original sense of someone who enjoys and is good at  programming--Raymond has included both "hacker" and  "cracker" as entries, of course.)  The entry on folklore is  simply hilarious; I wish I could just include Guy Steele''s "more  magic" story here, but I''ll just have to tell you to buy the  book.The entries are a real mixture.  Many, such as "indent  style", go beyond just defining the term: this entry gives examples of  the four major C styles and mentions the holy wars (another entry . . .)  which have occurred over them.  Some are quite current: Easter egg, kluge,  Trojan horse; others are arcane or dated, but still interesting: NeWS,  CP/M, chiclet keyboard.  All the entries are interesting and  well-written.Newcomers to the field may find a good deal of  enlightenment here, and old-timers will find a lot of memories.  My own  favourite entries relate to the old text-based game Adventure, which I  encountered on a CDC machine in 1981.  "I see no <X> here."  "Plugh!"  "Xyzzy!"  *Sigh*  It almost makes me miss  those old teletypes.');
INSERT INTO public."Reviews" (review_id, user_id, book_id, rating, review) VALUES (2418, 1800, 33, 4, 'Perhaps we should start by telling what this dictionary isn''t. First, it has nothing to do with breaking into computer systems and similar illegal activities which any layman would usually associate with hackers. It teaches you that hacking is not the correct name for breaking into computers, though. Second, it is not a dictionary of IT terminology. You can probably do your IT job quite well without knowing what a foobar is. And third, it is not a dictionary of the current cyber slang. The main reason for this is probably the fact that Eric Raymond is well beyond his teenage years.Altogether, I don''t even think The New Hacker''s Dictionary fits the category of a reference work. Instead I''d dare to call it literature in the form of a dictionary, much like the classical Devil''s Dictionary by Ambrose Bierce, or The Meaning of Liff by Douglas Adams. Sure, many entries can be used as reference, although a lot of them actually refer to historic software and hardware items like ITS, PDP-10 or LISP machines. The New Hacker''s Dictionary not the dry, encyclopedic style of dictionary - entries are written in an opinionated, juicy style. The humorous side of the dictionary - a work of a witty, creative hacker mind picking names for things - certainly vastly outweighs its practical side.So is this book for you? Yes, if the legendary MIT AI lab hacker scene fascinates you. Although LISP machines are gone, it''s perhaps still affecting your computing environment more than you think. For example: Linux, the free Unix clone, is built on top of the GNU project, which descends directly from the MIT AI lab hacker scene. And finally, is there any point in buying a printed book, if the complete text is available on Raymond''s web site so you can read it on-line?  I''d say it is. You see, it''s not particularly convenient to take your computer into the bath tub.');
INSERT INTO public."Reviews" (review_id, user_id, book_id, rating, review) VALUES (2419, 1801, 33, 5, 'This book gives some great insight into the mind of the hacker. And note hacker, NOT cracker! Hackers are unjustly maligned by the media as being evil types who just want to wreak havoc on big business and government computer systems, when in reality they view breaking in on security systems as a hobby and almost always alert the authorities to the system break-in.This dictionary of hacker terms (which can be hilarious, informative, or esoteric depending on their meaning) gives an idea of the creativity and mentality of the hackers and their distrust of huge corporations (ie "Broken Windows" for Sun''s "Open Windows," "Windoze" for Microsoft Windows, and so on). Reading though the definition of terms gives you an idea of how to "talk turkey" with said hackers, and even if I will always be just a "wannabe" hacker, it helps to be able to get an idea of the mindset of the hacker.At the back of the book, there''s even a brief compilation of hacker "folklore" and "legends," a portrait of a "typical hacker," and ways to help the hacker culture grow (like getting a free Unix system or contributing to organizations like the Free Software Foundation).Books like this one, The Cathedral and the Bazaar, and Open Sources give an excellent view of the hacker culture.');

I used this lively introduction to probability in class and I found it a pleasure to read it. The challenging problems and the way they are tackled using computer simulations before providing analytic solutions, gave the students a lot of insights. Also the key concepts and ideas from probability theory are treated in a very clear way. I wished I had seen this book before.');
INSERT INTO public."Reviews" (review_id, user_id, book_id, rating, review) VALUES (2435, 1817, 64, 5, 'Plato: Complete Works by Hackett PC far exceeds expectations. This book isn''t meant to sit on a shelf, but to be one''s constant companion. The translations are all modern, easy to read and yet precise. The beauty of the dialogues really shines. You get every single one of his dialogues and even quite a few that probably aren''t by him just for good measure.Not only does the content justify the higher price, but also the quality of the book itself. The sewn binding ensures years of use, and the red cloth under the dust jacket looks lovely. The paper is excellent and smooth; the copyright page reads, "The paper used in this publication meets the minimum requirements of American National Standard for Informational Sciences-Permenance of Paper for printed library materials."I can''t think of any reason to buy a smaller volume with only a few dialogues in it - if you love Plato, you will want to read all his works eventually, and this volume can serve you well and last a lifetime.');

I''m not a scholar or academic at all but this book is on the list of books to read before you die and it''s a classic so I wanted to read it.I have to say I loved the basic story about Anna, and also about the other characters but there were portions of this book that were painful to get through. I''m sure if I had studied Russia or Russian literature those parts would have been very interesting. Most of it seems to be social commentary on the ideals of the time...and farming...lots and lots of farming! These sections slowed the book down for me and that''s why it''s four stars and not five. Although I am working with a limited IQ quite frankly, and so this assessment is more a failing on my own part, and not that of the book.I did enjoy it very much. It has a lot to say about women and their place in society and how double standards applied to Anna but not to Vronsky because of what they''d done. Something that we can still relate to somewhat today. Women are typically shamed for their sexual behavior where as men are not. Tolstoy showed this beautifully and I really felt for Anna.');

I thought that the previous two books were excellent, but this final one blew away my expectations. It was a tremendously engaging read--like many people I often use the phrase "couldn''t put it down", but this time it was true. Karen Traviss created an incredibly human, believable, compelling ensemble of characters for the trilogy and she outdid herself with her writing this time. Even the artificial intelligence she wrote, Black-Box, comes across as more human and relatable than the protagonists of many other bestselling novels I''ve read, and I dare say some of the people that I actually know.While the past Halo books were fun expansions of the games'' universe with bits of history, world-building, and action, this trilogy--and especially Mortal Dictata--went far deeper than that. Mortal Dictata is a beautiful, deep exploration of morality, justice, and what it means to be human, at a level that I never expected out of the Halo novels (and I say that as an avid reader and fan of them) and it has earned a position as one of my three favourite books. It gives us a look at the minds of people who have done great things and terrible things to ensure the survival of the human race through a brutal war, and brings us along for the ride as they deal with the consequences of those actions.If you need a reason to read this book, it is this: Mortal Dictata asks us how far is too far to go when extinction is a real and immediate threat; if it being a novel based on a game series makes you think it won''t make you question not only your views on the subject, but the very notion of there being a right answer, I assure you that it will when it shows you--side by side and in vivid, living colour--the benefits and the human costs of actions taken for the greater good.');

Soon Caspian has an army backing his claim to the throne, but in a moment of desperation, he is forced to blow the magic horn of the legendary Queen Susan -- and subsequently pulls the Pevensies back into Narnia.But while only a year has passed on Earth, centuries have passed in Narnia, and the kids find that it''s no longer the place they left -- they and Aslan are distant memories, and their castle lies in ruins. And as they are led by a very skeptical dwarf to help Caspian, Lucy keeps glimpsing Aslan along the way -- a sign that things are about to change drastically in Narnia, both for the human and magical inhabitants...The Chronicles of Narnia were probably the first books to feature what is now standard in the fantasy genre -- an ordinary person gets dragged into another world.

While Lewis''s beliefs are presented in a more complicated and subtle manner in his other fictional works, here the parallels to basic Christian beliefs are very obvious. Reportedly even Tolkien, one of Lewis''s best pals, found the allegory annoying.But if you can get past the slightly ham-handed treatment, it''s a lovely little read. Lewis interweaves mythical elements -- dwarves, nymphs, talking animals, witches -- with the chatty, slightly precious style of traditional British storytelling.

But Caspian is a likable and believable prepubescent king-in-waiting, and surrounded by a bunch of unique Narnians -- a gentle yet fierce badger, a hostile dwarf, a fiery mouse, and the delightfully skeptical Trumpkin, who doesn''t believe in lions.Despite a few rough spots, "Prince Caspian" is a slightly darker, more intricate story, and its finale marks a turning point in the Chronicles of Narnia.

The prequel doesn''t interest me as it only sums up what happened before the tale of Thomas and the Gladers and features all new characters. No thanks.The first book in the series is the soon-to-be-in-theatres, movie adapted version of the book, The Maze Runner.Synopsis from Goodreads:"If you ain''t scared, you ain''t human."When Thomas wakes up in the lift, the only thing he can remember is his name. He''s surrounded by strangers--boys whose memories are also gone.Outside the towering stone walls that surround the Glade is a limitless, ever-changing maze. It''s the only way out--and no one''s ever made it through alive.Then a girl arrives. The first girl ever. And the message she delivers is terrifying.---While reading it, I was constantly very annoyed with the flow of writing; James Dashner''s unpolished writing and repetitiveness continued to bother me throughout this book and the entire series. His writing distracted me so much that it really took away from the book. I also found the novel quite boring, yet promising, but it constantly left me waiting in anticipation and disappointing me later on. I always refer to The Maze Runner as a book that would do well as a movie; the plot is intriguing and unique and they would strip away the irrelevant things and might even make it better than the book.The Scorch Trials, the second book in the series, I found more enticing.Synopsis from Goodreads:Solving the Maze was supposed to be the end.Thomas was sure that escape from the Maze would mean freedom for him and the Gladers. But WICKED isn’t done yet. Phase Two has just begun. The Scorch.There are no rules. There is no help. You either make it or you die.The Gladers have two weeks to cross through the Scorch—the most burned-out section of the world. And WICKED has made sure to adjust the variables and stack the odds against them.Friendships will be tested. Loyalties will be broken. All bets are off.There are others now. Their survival depends on the Gladers’ destruction—and they’re determined to survive.---I had originally planned to not continue the series as The Maze Runner didn''t satisfy me enough - or at least wait until I have time to read it - but I had someone tell me that I MUST continue; that James Dashner offers so much more in the last two books. I decided to take a chance and commit to the second book. It was definitely an improvement; it seemed as if Dashner was trying to appeal to an older audience as the gore and violence would be a little too much for a pre-teen, in my opinion. Some scenes were very graphic, but that made it all the more interesting. It was a lot more intriguing and kept me reading, excited for what would happen next as their lives continued to be in impending danger. New characters were introduced, loyalties were questioned, and a new problem was brought to the Gladers'' attention, bringing them closer to the truth.Last, but not least, The Death Cure.Synopsis on Goodreads:Thomas knows that Wicked can''t be trusted, but they say the time for lies is over, that they''ve collected all they can from the Trials and now must rely on the Gladers, with full memories restored, to help them with their ultimate mission. It''s up to the Gladers to complete the blueprint for the cure to the Flare with a final voluntary test.What Wicked doesn''t know is that something''s happened that no Trial or Variable could have foreseen. Thomas has remembered far more than they think. And he knows that he can''t believe a word of what Wicked says.The time for lies is over. But the truth is more dangerous than Thomas could ever imagine.Will anyone survive the Death Cure?---The improvement from The Scorch Trials dissipated, I guess, because this book reminded me of The Maze Runner; it lacked excitement, was promising, yet disappointing, and I was disappointed, but the writing has improved at least. There''s some action within the book that will have you on your toes, but you will reel back easily without even a skipped heartbeat. There wasn''t enough intensity in the novel until, basically, the very end. Things get intense then. Other than that, it didn''t excite me enough. The characters spent a lot of time running back and forth and a character is mentioned in The Scorch Trials and in The Death Cure that only receives the light of day at the conclusion of the novel. All finales are rushed though, they can''t help it.I believe the series as a whole was...good. Just "good". It is a series worth reading and many will enjoy it, but I wouldn''t call it my favourite series. If they were each individual books and not part of a series, I''d say read the Scorch Trials, but as a whole series, I don''t know. I''d probably say something like "The Maze Runner was okay, I guess, but The Scorch Trials was really good! The Death Cure was kind of boring." Also, the series as a whole was confusing; in each book, there was a new reason for WICKED''s methods. It was just too much information, he should have just picked one.Overall, it''s a good series. I would recommend it; I''m sure many will like it, and I absolutely cannot wait to see the movies! They should be amazing! It may not be the best series, but they''re worth reading. It brings a fresh, never before seen, idea to the bookshelves. Well, I''ve never read anything like it, but I don''t know for sure if there''s absolutely nothing like it. Anyways, enjoy, try to look past his writing style and you should be fine. And what I mean by his writing style, I am mainly talking about his fragmented sentences. For example, he would write something like this: "He screamed his throat raw, called for help."....................................................................................................................yeah. He does it constantly throughout the series. If you see nothing wrong with that sentence, then you should be able to enjoy the series.');

He was Professor of Medieval and Renaissance Literature at Cambridge, where he counted J.R.R. Tolkien among his friends. "The Horse and his Boy", the third book of the Chronicles of Narnia, was first published in 1954.Although the series is known as the "Chronicles of Narnia", much of the action takes place in the neighbouring countries of Calormen and Archenland. Shasta, the boy mentioned in the book''s title, is introduced first - he''s been brought up in Calormen by a fisherman called Arsheesh. One evening, a local prince stops with the pair and demands hospitality. Later, when Shasta overhears the prince and his father bartering for Shasta himself, he decides to run away. Luckily for Shasta, the prince''s horse is a captured Narnian horse called Bree - and, as a Narnian, Bree can talk. Bree has also set his heart on escaping and returning home and agrees to take Shasta with him - recognising the boy as either a fellow Narnian or an Archenlander, rather than being native to Calormen. The pair make off together that night and, before long, they are joined on the road by another fleeing pair : Aravis and Hwin. Aravis is a Calormen princess being forced to marry against her will while Hwin, like Bree, is a captured Narnian horse. The four escapees must make their way through Calormen''s capital, Tashbaan, and then across the northern desert to safety.It''s possible I''m seeing more in this book than was intended, and I know it''s supposed to be a kid''s book - but I''d have to describe the portrayal of Calormen''s people as not only the book''s big flaw but also very questionable. Physically, they''re described as having dark faces and wear turbans, while their favoured weapon is the scimitar. As individuals, only Aravis is portrayed in anything vaguely resembling a positive light. Arsheesh, Shasta''s foster-father, had no qualms about selling him into slavery, while Aravis'' father was apparently happy to arrange her man to the Grand Vizier - someone old enough to be her grandfather. Meanwhile, the Tisroc - Calormen''s ruler - is the sort of cheap and easy villain others have tried to fabricate again more recently : he actually sneers at the concept of freedom. Narnia''s King Edmund and Queen Susan also appear briefly - Queen Lucy''s appearance is barely even fleeting. Edmund, who didn''t exactly cover himself in glory in "The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe", maintains his low standards when his refers to Prince Rabadash as Susan''s "dark faced lover". He isn''t long in adding that Rabadash is "proud, bloody, luxurious, cruel and a self-pleasing tyrant". (From only a slightly different perspective, of course, the very same thing could be said about Peter - Narnia''s High King and Edmund''s brother). All of which is a great pity, as the bones of this story are much stronger than those of "The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe".');
INSERT INTO public."Reviews" (review_id, user_id, book_id, rating, review) VALUES (2474, 1853, 71, 4, '"The Horse And His Boy" is one of CS Lewis'' classic Narnia books, one of the later published but the third if taken chronologically. The tale takes place during the time period just before the end of "The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe," (roughly during the start of "Wardrobe''s" last chapter) and is largely independent of the other six Narnia books. All of the Narnia books can be read independently, but "Horse" in particular has little link to the others.The tale is a classic "young person escapes a bad life" story, and in the end becomes a classic "downtrodden young person saves the day" and a "young person of meager background is" - well, that would be giving something away. Time-tested clichés of the genre, to be sure, but not clichés in a bad way. In Lewis'' tale, this is a Good Thing. Because it works.The story concerns Shasta, a young boy, and a talking horse, Bree, who flee their evil masters in an attempt to reach the free land of Narnia to the north. In their flight they meet up with Aravis, a young girl also fleeing with a talking horse, Hwin. They adventure their way through the country of Calormen, a thinly-veiled substitute for the Middle Eastern countries of the real world.Like the best of children''s literature, the pacing is brisk and the obstacles to be overcome are introduced quickly and almost without pause.As in all the Narnia books, we are introduced to Aslan. This time Aslan''s role initially seems minor, but is revealed to have retroactively been a major role. It is among the worst uses of the lion in the series. Much of what the lions tells Shasta feel dreadfully like the famous poem "Footsteps," in which Jesus explains to a walker looking at his life traced in footsteps on the beach that those moments when there were but one set of footsteps, not two for the walker and Jesus, were moments when Jesus carried the walker through life, not the walker walking through his troubles alone. In "Horse," it slaps the reader from the story. Worse still is the fact that the entire meeting with Aslan is written in a gratingly worshipful tone that is horribly jarring; it does the story a great disservice. The scene, however, is mercifully short.Because "The Horse and His Boy" is a side adventure in Narnia more than anything else, it does not have as strong a connection, and therefore sentimental tug, as the rest of the books. Still, heavy-handed Aslan scene aside, "Horse" is a delightfully simple adventure about young people escaping a bad situation. Escapism is almost never a bad thing, especially for younger people who prefer to read over playing video games, and Lewis does it very well. Most readers will thoroughly enjoy this, even if it isn''t essential Narnia.');

They rank with the standard fare of impetuous women that Hemingway likes to write about.The scope of the stories is quite broad, featuring painful topics such as abortion, breakup, heartbreak and being past ones prime.  The latter theme is taken up in THE UNDEFEATED,  THE KILLERS and FIFTY GRAND and later on re-appears in Hemingway''s THE OLD MAN AND THE SEA.  FIFTY GRAND, which details the demise of a washed-up boxer, is my favorite short story in this collection.Stories such as IN ANOTHER COUNTRY, and NOW I LAY ME introduce motifs that are echoed in A FAREWELL TO ARMS, which was published just a few years after MWW.Tho I''ve never been enamoured with the short story genre, Hemingway does rank as one of the best in the business - particularly in the American literary canon.

Hemingway''s family was plagued by suicide, including that of his physician father, and, like all of us, Hemingway was once a young child coming to grips with the idea of mortality, in a world still fresh and fascinating and frightening.Other stories deal with the joys of a life full-lived, an appreciation of the natural world around us, and our "quiet desperation," in love, life, and death."The Nick Adams Stories" is high on my "Top Ten List."');

While incomplete as stories, they give insight into the creative process. Insofar as the stories Hemingway did publish, some are quite good: "Ten Indians", a story of adolescent love, rejection, and the resiliency of the teenage mind; "The Battler", a wonderful portrayal of mental illness among drifters and hobos; and "Fathers and Sons", a death meditation.Other stories, such as the famous "Big Two Hearted River" and "The Killers" are just not very good. What is the significance of "Big Two Hearted River" consisting of two parts? Beats the hell of me. And the entire story is about nothing but the rituals of fishing and camping, which Hemingway describes to the point of fetishization. There is something at the very end about the swamp being a "tragic" place to fish, but that there will be another time to confront it. Don''t be so obscure, Hem. What are you talking about? We''ll never know because the story is devoid as to what''s on Nick''s mind (See footnote below). And then "The Killers" is implausible: contract killers are not ingenue who intentionally leave evidence trails and toss out incriminating statements; and witnesses do call the cops.What I notice about all of the stories is that Hemingway mostly focuses on external things, and that little or nothing of the characters'' inner lives is revealed. Because details of hunting, fishing and camping are interesting to a point only, ultimately, I lose interest. Hemingway''s style is also annoying: he was too much the reporter and not enough the poet. Because he never sings, very little description is unique or memorable.We must remember that these stories were written and published in the 1920s and 1930s. At that time Art Deco - simple, unadorned, streamlined - was popluar. Perhaps Hemingway, like many great artists, subconsciously intuited the zeitgeist, or spirit of the time, and reflected that in his writing. Hemingway''s style and substance now seem dated. But at one time, like Art Deco, they were revolutionary. Perhaps that explains Hemingway''s once extraordinary popularity which seems incomprehensible now.FOOTNOTE: I have since discovered that such obscurity was intentional and evidently first applied during the writing of this story. Hemingway describes this literary device in "Hunger Was A Good Discipline", which appears on page 75 in A MOVEABLE FEAST, as his ". . . new theory that you could omit anthing if you knew you omitted and the omitted part would strengthen the story and make people feel something more than they understood. . . .

I''d probably give this book 3.5 stars, somewhere between it was good and it was OK, if I could.The first of the three sections of this novel is truly good.  It introduces us to Thomas Hudson, a painter and a thinly veiled Hemingway, and his life on the island of Bimini.  Hudson, like Hemingway, is an artist who is serious about his craft and about his work ethic.  We learn of his life among the characters of the island, including the locals and his friends.  The richest part of all is the visit of his three sons (by his first two wives) and the good times they share.  There is good character development of all three boys, each so different from the others and each showing different parts of their father''s personality.  And there are the friends and servants of Hudson''s, whom he loves and who play important parts in his son''s lives, often where it is difficult for a father to enter.  There is a tense shark attack and an epic battle with a monster marlin by the middle son, and there is a great deal of psychology of boys and men woven richly throughout.  Hudson is a father who can''t seem to love all-out, whole-heartedly, even though his sons need and want it.  The feelings are there but the wiring in Hudson''s head and heart shorts out a little and never conducts his deepest, truest self to his boys.  Tragically, Hudson learns of the death of his two youngest sons and their mother (his second wife) at the close of the story.The middle section of the book certainly has some good description and some realistic conversation, but overall it is one running conversation after another, mostly in the context of a bar where Hudson and his companions (who come and go) are drinking heavily, about very little of any importance.  Hudson has just gotten wind of his first son''s death (a pilot in WWII) and ultimately this accounts for the drinking but probably also for the attempts by Hudson to avoid any topic of significance in his conversations with others.  Hudson''s first wife and the only woman he ever deeply loved shows up and they have a rendezvous before Hudson can work up the fortitude to tell her of their son''s death.  They grieve and love together and she has to leave.  All in all, a draggy and hopeless section of this story that doesn''t live up to the first and last sections.The last section follows Hudson and his crew as they conduct anti-submarine activities from his small ship (or large boat) in and around Cuba.  The story is a game of cat and mouse in which Hudson and his crew is the cat and the surviving crew members from a German U-boat is the mouse.  Hemingway builds tension in the hunt and between Hudson''s crew members well.  There are some really exciting moments and some truly touching interaction between Hudson and his crew, as they must try to overcome their differences and dislikes of each other to band together to find and fight the enemy.  After the middle section this is a welcome change...there is actually stuff happening here, a plot.  But it does pail in comparison to the richness of the opening section of this book.All in all, I was glad I read this but the middle section prevents me from liking this book with anything close to whole-heartedness.  And if you are someone who enjoys happy endings, none of the three sections of this book end that way.  The reader is left thinking that likely, as the sons went, so the father goes.  There is much tragedy and hopelessness in this book, which too is a fair reflection of Hemingway''s own life.');

This is one of my favorite Hemingway books and one of the few published posthumously that lives up to his legacy.The book, broken into three distinct sections, recounts chapters in the life of Thomas Hudson, a somewhat thinly veiled version of Hemingway. That''s not to say that this is a story about Hemingway himself, but its pretty clear there is a lot of Hemingway in Hudson.The first section, considered by many to be the best (and, as a I recall, the focus of the film made of the book), takes place in Bimini, where Hudson is leading a fairly idyllic life. The second is centered in Cuba but has an entirely different tone from that of the first. Whereas the "Bimini" section is almost light-hearted and somewhat breezy, the tone of the Cuba section has changed dramatically. Hudson is now a depressed individual having lost a son in an accident. He has a reunion with his first wife, but even though she is the love of his life, he knows it won''t end happily. The third part, "At Sea," recounts Hudson''s efforts as a Nazi sub hunter.Hemingway is at his best throughout much of the book, his men are all striving to prove that they are, well, men, or at least the ideal of what a man should be in Hemingway''s eyes. And naturally enough, no Hemingway man, in this case Hudson, would be complete without a little tragedy in his life. "At Sea," while powerfully told, seems somehow incomplete, which may well be the case since I do not think Hemingway completed the book before his death. In fact, the ending seemed extremely abrupt and left me wondering, did Hudson survive his wounds?Still, this is some of Hemingway''s best work. A must read. The only reason I did not give it five stars is because of the abrupt ending and a few other brief passages in the book that seem somehow incomplete and unfinished.');

They''re American, of course, and to Hemingway the best way to be American is to spend as much time as possible in Europe.  As the title implies, the setting of David and Catherine''s romantic idyll is nothing short of paradise, a splendor of leisure, food, and drink -- and there is indeed a lot of drinking.One day Catherine returns to the hotel where she and David are staying with her hair cut short as a boy''s; this simple but suggestive act precipitates a flurry of homoerotic innuendoes that pervade the remainder of the novel.  At Cannes they meet a beautiful European girl named Marita who is attracted -- sexually -- to both of them, as they are to her.  She becomes their traveling companion and, with everybody''s consent, makes love to Catherine and then to David, but not, I''m afraid, at the same time.  If this menage a trois is supposed to represent the Fall, with Marita playing the role of the Serpent, it seems that Paradise is not yet lost.As a writer, David (like his creator) lets his life become his work, and he is currently inspired to write a story about elephant hunting with his father in Africa, a reminiscence of a transformative boyhood event.  Catherine, an idle and apparently rich girl with no professional aspirations of her own except to char herself to a crisp getting the darkest tan she can, is jealous of his work and the authorial attention he gets; Marita, also rich (Catherine frequently calls her Heiress), is more sympathetic to David''s intense artistic nature.  He is clearly too narcissistic to be in love with anybody but himself and his own work, and being married to him means having to accept that, which may be too much of a sacrifice for Catherine to make.Hemingway''s trademark is that he makes his characters so complex precisely by having them say so little.  The dialogue here is laconic and breezy, as though verbosity would be tedious in a place of such beauty and with people so blithe and lax.  The easy, free flow of the narrative, giving the impression of having been written on autopilot, belies the fact that Hemingway spent the last fifteen years of his life working on this novel sporadically, evidently putting a tremendous amount of consideration into the statement he wanted to make.  Like most of his statements, it bears his unmistakable stamp of restlessness and of impatience with the normal course of the world.');

I discovered this after reading the book in one of his biographical accounts.  It seems that he wrote this one to process out his inner feelings about the actual relationship he lived through.  I wonder how he felt in retrospect?  At times his main character David seems bitter about the whole thing.  At other times he is definitely caught up in it.  He is written much like a puppet, controlled by his wife and the circumstances he runs into.Catherine is one of the more complex female characters that Hemingway ever portrayed.  She reminds me of a more fleshed out Brett, from The Sun Also Rises.  Catherine has a very nihilistic view of life.  She seems driven to do everything in her power to destroy herself and all who cross her path.  She wants pleasure.  She wants to feel good about herself, but just can''t seem to find a way to acheive it.  Poor Catherine...  I couldn''t help but feel for her the whole way through the book.  She seems lost and unwilling to find her way or be found.I wonder if Hemingway was simply journaling on this experience, never wanting to share it at all?  I guess we''ll never know...After hearing the fact that this is a reflection of his real life experiences, I understand why it left me feeling odd.

It was first published in 1995, and considerable work has been done in genetic algorithms since then, but it could still serve as an adequate introduction.  Emphasizing the scientific and machine learning applications of genetic algorithms instead of applications to optimization and engineering, the book could serve well in an actual course on adaptive algorithms. The author includes excellent problem sets at the end of each chapter, these being divided up into "thought exercises" and "computer exercises", and in the latter she includes some challenge problems for the ambitious reader. Chapter 1 is an overview of the main properties of genetic algorithms, along with a brief discussion of their history. The role of fitness landscapes and fitness functions is clearly outlined, and the author defines genetic algorithms as methods for searching fitness landscapes for highly fit strings. An elementary example of a genetic algorithm is given, and the author compares genetic algorithms with more traditional search methods. The author emphasizes the unique features of genetic algorithms that distinguish them from other search algorithms, namely the roles of parallel population-based search with stochastic selection of individuals, and crossover and mutation. A list of applications is given, and two explicit examples of applications are given that deal with the Prisoner''s Dilemna and sorting networks. The author also gives a brief discussion as to how genetic algorithms work from a more mathematical standpoint, emphasizing the role of Holland schemas. The reader more prepared in mathematics can consult the references for more in-depth discussion. The next chapter stresses the role of genetic algorithms in problem solving, beginning with a discussion of genetic programming. Automatic programming has long been a goal of computer scientists, and the author discusses the role of genetic programming in this area, particularly the work of John Koza on evolving LISP programs. In addition, she discusses the current work on evolving cellular automata and its role in automatic programming. The latter discussion is more detailed, this resulting from the author''s personal involvement in artificial life research. Those interested in time series prediction tools will appreciate the discussion on the use of genetic algorithms to predict the behavior of dynamical systems, with an example given on predicting the behavior of the (chaotic) Mackey-Glass dynamical system. The author also gives applications of genetic algorithms in predicting protein structure, an area of application that has exploded in recent years, due to the importance of the proteome projects. The area of neural networks has also been influenced by genetic algorithms, and the author discusses how they have replaced the familiar back-propagation algorithm as a method to find the optimal weights. Chapter 3 is more in line with what the author intended in the book, namely a discussion of the relevance of genetic algorithms to study the mechanisms behind natural selection. She discusses the "Baldwin effect", which gives a connection between what an organism has learned (a small time-scale process) to the evolutionary history of the Earth (a long time-scale process). A simple model of the Baldwin effect is given using a genetic algorithm, along with a discussion of the Ackley-Littman evolutionary reinforcement learning model, which involves the use of neural networks, and which is another computational demonstration of the Baldwin effect. In addition, the author discusses models for sexual selection and ecosystems based on genetic algorithms. These are the "artificial life" models that the author has been involved in, and she gives a very understandable overview of their properties. Chapter 4 should suit the curiosity of the mathematician or computer scientist who wants to understand the theoretical justification behind the use of genetic algorithms. Again employing the Holland notion of schemas and adaptation as a "tension between exploration and exploitation", the author formulates a mathematical model, called the Two-Armed Bandit Problem, of how genetic algorithms are used to study the tradeoffs in this tension. The level of mathematics used here is very elementary with the emphasis placed on the intuition behind this model, with only a sketch of the model''s solution given. To address the role of crossover in genetic algorithms, the author discusses in detail a class of fitness landscapes, called "Royal Road functions" that she and others have developed. The performance of the genetic algorithm employed is then compared against the three different hill-climbing methods. Formal mathematical models of genetic algorithms are also discussed, one of which involves dynamical systems, another using Markov chains,  and one using the tools of statistical mechanics. The latter is very interesting from a physics standpoint but is only briefly sketched. The interested physicist reader can consult the references given by the author for further details. Practical use of genetic algorithms demands an understanding of how to implement them, and the author does so in the last chapter of the book. She outlines some ideas on just when genetic algorithms should be used, and this is useful since a newcomer to the field may be tempted to view a genetic algorithm as merely a fancy Monte Carlo simulation. The most difficult part of using a genetic algorithm is how to encode the population, and the author discusses various ways to do this. She also details various "exotic" approaches to improving the performance of genetic algorithms, such as the "messy" genetic algorithms. One must also choose a selection method when employing genetic algorithms, and the author shows how to do this using various techniques, such as roulette wheel and stochastic universal sampling. In addition, genetic operators must also be chosen in implementing genetic algorithms, and the author emphasizes crossover and mutation for this purpose. Lastly, the values of the parameters of the genetic algorithm, such as population size, crossover rate, and mutation rate must be chosen. The author discusses various approaches to this. Although brief, she does give a large set of references for further reading.');

The second chapter discusses evolving programs in Lisp and cellular automata. Also included in this chapter is a discussion of predicting dynamical systems.

De Berniers''s obvious love of  his characters, his painstaking research, his use of challenging vocabulary  that often sent me gleefully into the dictionary, his masterful unfolding  of plot -- all combined to keep me in continual awe of his writing. And  now, about THAT ending: Yes, there was a definite shift from the intricate  details of most of the book, which covered a relatively short period of  time. But to cover decades in that same detailed style would be utterly  impossible! (Unless it becomes a multi-volume epic, which I believe in this  case would be unsustainable.) I was impressed, actually, that De Berniers  was able to give enough details to make the unfolding of those decades not  too rushed. It was like travelling on a speeding train through the  landscape, but stopping long enough in some places to get one''s bearings,  get a decent feel for the time and place, and even go into some shops and  have a nice meal and a chat with the locals.

The characters remained  essentially consistent, although circumstances and their lives had  drastically changed.

This short tale is of a family totally controlled and dominated by a father''s greed. The father actually weighs out eggs, butter, flour, and sugar for the family servant to use every day. His wife, daughter, and family servant all have adjusted their views of reality to accomodate his greed. The equilibrium is upset when Cousin Charles Grandet comes to visit. The women in the household cater to the needs of this handsome young man but the father is unsympathetic upon hearing that his brother has become bankrupt and a suicide and the young man is penniless. By the time the young man leaves, the daughter of the house is totally in love with him. She writes to Charles but after a few letters he fails to respond further to her letters. As the miserly father withers and dies, so too does the expectations and soul of his daughter, Eugenie. Balzac did a really fine job of showing how self defeating the miser''s greed was to his family and his relationship with his wife and child. After the death of the father, Eugenie inherits a fortune. Cousin Charles meanwhile has become rich through the slave trade between African and the Caribbean. His soul has shrunk and he is about to marry a 19 year old socialite for her family connections. He writes a letter telling Eugenie that he has never stopped loving her but that he must look out for his interests with this advantageous marriage. He receives a letter back that is polite yet biting, gracious yet revengeful, compassionate and understanding yet reminding of the lost opportunity. Charles then finds out that his cousin, whom he loves, is extremely wealthy and he has made a decision that he thought was advantageous which turned out to be less than optimal. Balzac has the faithful maid as the only winner in the story.  Eugenie rewards her for her years of hard work and service. The story resonates with Henry James'' Washington Square. They both involve a triangle between a rich father, an innocent daughter, and a suitor. The difference is that James'' father is cruel to his daughter thinking that since she is plain and shy that men will court her only for money. Eugenie''s father''s obsession was wealth, the effects on his family were a consequence of his greed, not due to his conscious demeaning sarcasm. Both heroines seek revenge on the suitor, James'' with a trick and Balzac''s with a superbly written letter that left the revenge to his own immagination and judgement. James'' suitor was indeed a crook, whereas Charles Grandet was lead into opportunism and missed chances. Finally, the Aunt in Washington Square was a silly gossip who was not supportive of the daughter/niece whereas the mother and servant in Eugenie Grandet were supportive of Eugenie. I would strongly recommend reading Eugenie Grandet, a concise,short, book. Balzac was just to his characters and this realistic justice made for a fine short novel.');

At the age of 20 years he already published more than a hundred books all describing very human characters, portrayed in a prose with an unseen force. Because the same characters appeared often in more than one book, Balzac created a universe of his own, which he himself called "La Comédie Humaine".In Eugénie Grandet, a novel dating from 1833, one gets acquainted with father Grandet, an extremely wealthy and greedy aristocrat living together with his wife and daughter in Saumur, France.  His daughter Eugénie has grown to maturity and her father has no other goal than to see her getting married. But who is suitable enough for his precious daughter? Surely not her adopted nephew Charles Grandet, not? Eugénie has to fight against the tyrannical power of her father, but gets help from their faithful servent, Nanon.Through this tragedy Balzac reveals one of the most destructive vices of man: greed. Although the author does not recoil from an ever-growing list of moralizing statements, the story stays authentic enough to pull the reader into the story. The comparison with a masterpiece as Wuthering Heights is easily made and not only because it dates from the same period. But to make from Eugénie Grandet a true classic it certainly misses depth.');

This is a despicable man, but like good characters in literature, he has an understandable, if unjustifiable, reason for his behavior. He wants to give his family a perennial financial security. The problem is, that is all he wants for his family. Nothing else matters. So the family leads a monastical life, luxury is forbidden, joy is expensive. Eugenie is a likable but shy young lady, without any knowledge of the world whatsoever. Balzac is just great at creating the environment and mood. You can see the big, old house, the leaves fallen from the trees and rustling in the silent evenings of this town. You can feel the boredom of lifeless life, the long, long afternoons. The avaricious man lecturing everybody for spending like crazy, anguished at every penny spent, regardless of what was bought or consumed.So, two families are looking forward to having one of their sons married to Eugenie, but Daddy is looking for more wealth, and refuses to share his with these provincial people. Then his brother committs suicide in account of financial trouble, and Grandet''s nephew, Charles, comes to town. He and Eugenie fall in love, but there is no chance M. Grandet will accept a marriage with the son of a ruined man. Charles, thus, leaves for the Indies to look for fortune. Someday he''ll come back, but things will never be the same.

Well, having just had the experience (and it is an experience) of reading John Cleland''s 1748-9 novel, "Memoirs of a Woman of Pleasure," everything else just seems like children''s literature. Cleland''s "Memoirs" was simultaneously reviled and a best seller, declared obscene and yet continued to be published illegally througout the 18th century. In the aftermath of the public frenzy for and against Samuel Richardson''s ultra-famous novels "Pamela" and "Clarissa" and Henry Fielding''s equally famous responses, "Shamela," "Joseph Andrews," and "Tom Jones," Cleland''s novel strikes out into wholly uncharted moral and aesthetic territory.Similarly to Defoe''s "Moll Flanders," Cleland''s novel begins with its heroine, Fanny Hill, an innocent, uneducated country girl, thrown at a very early age into the cruel world of London and forced into a life of prostitution. As an innocent virgin, the madam whose house she live in is saving Fanny for a noble customer whom they expect daily, but learns about sexual commerce by watching other prostitutes in the house. Eloping with a beautiful, wealthy young man named Charles before she engages in any sexual activity, the novel concerns Fanny''s sexual awakenings and her life with and without her first love, Charles. The way that the novel refigures fidelity in the relationship between Fanny and Charles is astounding.Cleland''s master-stroke, if you will, linguistically, is to write a whole-heartedly pornographic novel and couch everything in such a rich variety of metaphors. Graphic scenarios can be found on almost every page, but there is a marked and remarkable absence of graphic language. Structurally, Cleland''s plotting of Fanny Hill''s escapades is exquisitely balanced and even-handed. Morally and aesthetically, "Memoirs" comes straight out of the strain of 18th century moral philosophy associated by turns, with Shaftesbury and David Hume. From Shaftesbury, Cleland takes the idea that aesthetics and morality should be judged on an equal form in works of art. From Hume, he takes the radical stance that vices and luxuries are not inherently evil, and even acceptable when not carried to extremes. Cleland makes judicious use of these structural and philosophical elements in creating one of the strongest and most liberated heroines in English literature.Among other points of interest in the novel, there is the prevalence and even propriety of expressions of feminine desire, agency, power, and control over self and circumstances. Aside from her first entrance into London and her various periods as a kept-mistress, Fanny Hill is educated by the prostitute Phoebe, and the procuress Mrs. Cole to be an independent, self-regulating subject. Related to this is the rather revolutionary notion inferred that sexual education predicates all other sources of knowledge, and is at heart, the basis and foundation of human interaction, at least in the semi-utopic world of the novel.There are so many fascinating things about Cleland''s "Memoirs of a Woman of Pleasure," it would take forever to puzzle through them all. All the same, I''ve only been able myself to think critically about the novel at some distance of remove from reading it. Reading this novel was an interesting, but frustrating, and at times impossible task. It''s not a difficult novel to read in terms of prose, but for a 188 page novel, it tends to overwhelm everything else while you''re reading it. Like I said, reading "Memoirs" is an experience - I often had to look at the cover to recall that this is no simple work of pornography, but an acknowledged work of classic literature. By all accounts, a captivating novel. It gets five stars just because it is so amazing and outlandish. Aside from the Marquis de Sade, who belongs properly to the excesses of the Romantic Era, I had no idea that there was anything even remotely like this in the 18th century.  To quote that immortal philospher, Stephon Marbury, Cleland''s novel is "all nude...but tastefully done."');

Unlike most porn, she''s not always happy about her sexual encounters, and there are times when she''s heartbroken over a lost love.  She''s decieved by a woman who claims to be hiring her "as a companion," in a another scene she''s exploited by a money-hungry landlord.As she grows older, though, Fanny becomes more in charge of her sexuality and more open to exploration.  We, as readers, also see a glimpse of 18th-century prostitution and the demimonde of kept mistresses (which many wealthy men of the period kept).Hardly a rollicking farce (there are times when sex has serious consequences) but at times it is humorous.  Never crass or vulgar, but nevertheless explicit, this bawdy gem is worth checking out.  Fanny is always honest about herself and what she does to survive, and pulls no punches.  (I took away a star because, at times, it is difficult going because of the outdated language, but don''t let that deter you.)');

I was expecting a story that made much of a few kisses behind the pantry door or a bared ankle or two, but I was certainly wrong about that.Cleland manages to write a steamy story without ever being crass or resorting to using filthy language to get a reaction.  It''s hard to belive that it was published in 1749. Everything about the people in the novel seems so modern and no one ever thinks that the people of Cleland''s time even had thoughts or lives like he describes.Yet this novel has it''s problems too.The plot is an old one, young innocent country girl goes to the big city to seek her fortune and falls in the hands of some disreputable people.  It''s a story that''s as old as the profession the book is about.  At one point in the novel I wondered if maybe the people who wrote the script for Pretty Woman had been reading Fanny Hill for plot ideas.Cleland starts a very nice love story for our heroine, but then it fades out for most of the novel and returns without warning or explanation at the end.  In fact, the end of the novel seemed rushed in this readers opinion, and rendered the whole story a bit silly.  Not to mention a couple of holes in the plot that are big enough to drive a Mack truck through.Overall, it''s a good book, and should be read if for no other reason than to see for yourself just how erotic it really is.

The diamond carried a curse which brought trouble to whom ever possessed it.In brief "The Moonstone" is a suspenseful story of the gifting of the diamond to a young lady on her 18th birthday in 1848, its disappearance the same night and the subsequent search for it until 1850.The way the mystery is told is most interesting. Eleven different characters relating their role as well as to what they could personally attest to the robbery. This provides various views on what occurred and how the actions of others were interpreted.In these narratives the reader learns of the history of the diamond and it''s three Indian protectors, the gifting, the loss and the search for the diamond from a long-time servant in the country home of the wealthy family, the poor Christian spinster cousin who thrives on doing good work and spreading the faith. Two male cousins one a gambler and the other somewhat of a dilettante, both wishing to marry the same cousin. The wealthy side of the family, the family solicitor, the village doctor and his assistant, a police sargent who specializes in family thefts and roses, and a well traveled man with certainty some Indian heritage. It provides an interesting cross-section of life in Victorian England.It is one of the earliest mystery novels written, and was serialized, likely in a newspaper, when first published.

Other reviewers  can do this in a more lengthy and detailed fashion, but  I had not read this since 1952 when it was a major item on an advanced course in American literature when it was cited for two achievements by Hemingway.  The first and most outstanding is style which originates with his job as a journalist with the Toronto Daily Star.  That paper''s style book was the guide for Hemingway in all his writings - both journalistic and fictional. The second characteristic was the structure of his story where the major element was unstated in narrative, leaving the impact to the imagination as it was sketched by the actions and words of his characters. In the case of The Sun Also Rises, the style is obviously a significant departure from the Victorian sludge that demanded lengthy artistic passages depicting settings and motivations.  In this book, Jake''s sexual impotence due to a wartime aircraft accident is not only understated but dealt by ellipses.  But also with Hemingway, the impact of frustrated passion by Lady Brett and Jake is defined by sexual frustration, not love.  A real love would have found ways for them to live together and get around the problem. I find Hemingway''s approach is more typical of his macho testosterone obsession with  everything. While sexual attraction and fulfillment (and some will say procreation)  is the essence of relations between a man and a woman, wiser heads know that real love is found in the deeper relationships between personalities as well as the flesh.Moreover, I think the so-called "lost generation" thing is overdone, as is the bullfight nonsense.  Because a few artists, writers and wannabes gathered at the pumps on the Left Bank does not make them typical of a generation - what was typical in my opinion was the revulsion from the war and its affect on  Western civilization.  Most people got on with the job of having kids - establishing families - out of the personal wreckage of the war. In short, I felt the story was overblown as a universal of the times.Finally, a note about the Kindle version which I downloaded. All of Hemingway''s novels which I have recently read in Kindle suffer from word breaks and elisions and mis-scanned letters. Of course at the price one can hardly complain or expect word-by-word.editing.But all-told,an interesting and useful refresher to the world of Hemingway - but there are story lines that I like much better: as examples: "For Whom The Bell Tolls" and "A Farewell to Arms".

On this 1933-34 African safari, his jovial, Socratic drinking pal "Pop" is actually Phillip Percival the famous white hunter  who conducted Theodore Roosevelt on his first African safari.  As a young  man, Hemingway owned a copy of TR''s book "African Game Trails,"  and it is undoubtedly one of the reasons he went on this safari, which was  financed to the tune of $25,000 Depression dollars by his wife Pauline''s  uncle Gus, part owner of Richard Hudnut cosmetics.  Further evidence of  Hem''s fascination with Africa can be seen in the way Jake Barnes teases  Robert Cohn in "The Sun Also Rises."  In chapter two, Jake says,  " Did you ever think about going to British East Africa to  shoot?"  Cohn''s lack of enthusiasm for an immediate trek to Mombassa  seals his fate as a jerk.  "Green Hills" vindicates Hem''s real  aficion for hunting--filled with long descriptions of the arduous and  sometimes futile tracking of game, not just celebratory "kills."  Finally, the best preparation for reading "The Short Happy Life of  Francis Macomber" and "The Snows of Kilimanjaro" is to hike  and sweat through these 300 pages of African "country."  The  long, crescent-horned sable which Hem was painstakingly stalking at the end  of "Green Hills" never turned up.  But instead, the experience of  his African safari, was distilled into those two incredible stories--one  about a coward who gets a chance to redeem himself and the other about a  washed-up writer whose approaching death stimulates him to dream about--and  the reader to enjoy--the fiction he never got to actually write.  Unless  you''ve got a rich uncle or wife, this is as close as you''ll get to an East  African safari, and it is very, very fine.');

It went a  long way in establishing Hemingway''s reputation as a hunter and adventurer.  Though non-fiction it has the organization of a Hemingway novel and reads  much like his other works.  His descriptions of the landscape, local  people, other hunters, and especially animals, hunting, and killing are  superb.  Hemingway also shares, mostly as dialogue, his thoughts on life,  war, fate, and notably literature and the literary life.  His often-quoted  idea of all American literature being descended from one book by Mark Twain  is presented here, as are his thoughts on how America destroys its writers.  Some knowledge of Eastern Africa (such as a basic history, a guidebook, an  encyclopedia article) might be useful as Hemingway often does provide much  introductory material.  With "Green Hills of Africa" Hemingway  follows in the footsteps of Theodore Roosevelt''s "African Game  Trails"; both did much to popularize among Americans the idea of  recreational travel in Africa.  Hemingway went on to write two fictional  stories set in Africa: "The Snows of Kilimanjaro" and "The  Short Happy Life of Francis Macomber".  A good book, moreso for fans  of Papa and those with an interest in Africa.');

On one level it''s a recounting of a big-game safari that Hemingway undertook with one of his many wives (referred to only by initials, POM) and two of their friends - Karl, whom he finds himself rivalling in a bid to bag the best game; Mr JP or Pop, in real life an acclaimed hunter/guide who apparently accompanied Roosevelt on a safari.The details can be a bit confusing as the four of them move, sometimes together and sometimes separately, across a lot of African country that is differentiated only by the quality of its game and a lot of long African names that are impossible to keep track of.  Otherwise it''s easygoing - this is Hemingway''s simple direct prose at its best, and probably the most readable of his books that I''ve come across so far.  There is a simplicity and contentment in his writing that evokes very well the lifestyle they led, untroubled by anything except the desire to shoot the perfect kudu; each day spent in a beautiful country eating, reading, walking and hunting, then going to sleep and waking to do the exact same things; where all triumphs and tragedies are to do with hunting and no world beyond that exists.  For once Hemingway even has a happyending!  It''s certainly an eye-opener for the majority of us who, not being rich white expatriates in a time when environmentalism and animal rights hardly merited concern, will never embark on a safari.  The fact that it''s wholly non-fiction is a trifle surprising, for events build up to a convenient climax, and the ending contains convenient closure.Delve a little deeper and Hemingway allows us to accompany him through his thoughts - his reflections on Africa, hunting, writing, living.  He has a knack for looking at things in an unique light, reducing concepts down to simple terms and insisting that this is the way things are... Also, an idea of the author himself - the type of person he is - is built up quite clearly, more so than in ''A Moveable Feast''.  There the author as a distinct individual never quite took shape; here he does, a character with his own follies and graces....  but it''s interesting and well-written - two');

INSERT INTO public."Reviews" (review_id, user_id, book_id, rating, review) VALUES (2752, 2119, 178, 5, 'Jurgis Rudkis was a young Lithuanian with a dream of betterment - a dream better met in America than where he lived.  At the start of the 20th century, he and a group of similarly hopeful Lithuanians made their pilgrimage to the beating heart of capitalism, only to find the heel of its boot.  After navigating their way to Chicago’s meat packing district, the families endure extreme hardship and the brutal underside rather than uplifting promise of capitalism.The Jungle draws comparison to other tales of hardship – for example Faulkner’s The Grapes of Wrath – but Sinclair offers a twist.  Rather than a study of characters caught up in an epic event such as the Depression-era Dust Bowl, Sinclair uses his characters’ hardship to critique the setting itself.  More specifically, the characters are a vehicle to highlight the uneven and immoral impacts of capitalism, and to deliver a lesson in left-leaning (socialist?) economics and politics.Sinclair advances his theme in four stages.  First, in the largest section, he chronicles the dehumanizing work in Chicago’s meat packing district and the revolting methods the plant owners use to pass off inedible meat to unwitting consumers.  If it’s not enough to make readers question the balance of power between labor and capital, it will certainly make them rethink what they eat.The second, shorter stage shows Jurgis via a scrape with the law up against the broader industrial/political/media complex.  It’s not so much that the law is stacked against Jurgis; the justice is perfunctory and with the barest standards of due process.  Rather, it is the systemic intertwining political and industrial connections of others accused and acquitted, and of those meting out justice that rankles Sinclair.  “Government existed under the form of a democracy. The officials who ruled it, and got all the graft, had to be elected first; and so there were two rival sets of grafters, known as political parties, and the one got the office which bought the most votes.”The third stage - an interlude, really - follows Jurgis as a hobo after turning his back on Chicago, capitalism, and the social contract.  He lives by his wits when a chance encounter permits him inside a meat packing industrialist’s mansion.  The unneeded, undeserved and unproductive wealth stands in stark contrast to laborers’ deprivation and drives home Sinclair’s message about unfettered capitalism.  Jurgis’ life as a hobo, outside the capital/labor struggle, harkens back to an idyllic (Edenic, not Hobbesian) time before capitalism, and foreshadows the possibility of another path … but not before Jurgis takes a turn working within the power structure, which proves less punishing than as a laborer but equally unfruitful.The fourth stage reconciles the plot elements of the first three stages and presents a socialist alternative.  “In America everyone had laughed at the mere idea of Socialism then — in America all men were free.  As if political liberty made wage slavery any the more tolerable!”  The Hobbesian bargain had metastasized under the natural power imbalances of capitalism, just as Marx had warned a few decades earlier, and the promise of socialism offered Jurgis a third path.  He need not choose between the perpetually antagonistic labor and capital, but rather from a third option, in which one could select a job and receive remuneration based upon his or her contribution (labor hours and skill), all of which would advance broader societal goals.  Government (rather than the oppressive capitalists) would establish the value of labor contributions.  Sinclair envisioned a workers’ movement which would gently rule, and progress would be guided by ‘an invisible hobo hand’.Written after both Adam Smith’s and Marx’s theorizing but before the Russian Revolution, history has since shown the weakness of Sinclair’s concluding sermon, and even the labor theory of value that Sinclair touts was being supplanted when the book was written.  Still, The Jungle is a seminal and cautionary tale of the power struggle between capital and labor.  It applies equally well to the disposability of labor in today’s era of globalization and automation, and perhaps to intellectual capital in the coming era of Artificial Intelligence.Sinclair’s plot is straightforward – simply a vehicle to critique the capitalist system – and offers none of the rollicking twists in Dickens’ working-class novels.  Nor does it feature the robust character development of other authors.  What it does offer is one of the first literary indictments of unfettered capitalism, and for this it should be read by all with an interest in politics and economics.');

Everybody goes through some dose of solitude through life, and it''s nice to be able to reflect through Marquez''s characters. What is interesting for me though is that most of the characters would be committed into instructions or jailed in our modern societies. However, with all their idiosyncrasies, obsessive-compulsiveness, and plain madness, they all managed to go through their existences long before the advent of mind-numbing medications.Life was sure simpler, and far more entertaining back in this era. I would recommend this book, to anybody who wants to expand their literary horizons, and their understanding of some dark corners of human nature.I can only hope that Marquez is spending the last days of his life at peace with his solitude...');

This epic love story that spans decades. It''s impossible to capture it''s brilliance and to really express what it is about. In today''s time and age, ''love story'' carries a connotation that isn''t really fitting for this book, but I hope ''epic'' captures this.What''s most brilliant about Márquez is how he vividly captures the imagination and leads you into this world, where you feel that you are living the lives of the characters and you learn about them. In this manner, you also learn a lot about your own life and human nature in general, which makes his work powerful.Furthermore, in describing these lives from mundane details to the extraordinary, he weaves in a subtle social commentary regarding such diverse topics as gender relations, race, class, politics. The thing that strikes me the most about this is that he does this all without becoming ''preachy'' but in the subtlest fashion.It leaves you with a sense of the power of love, a love that is currently not in fashion, but also with the sense that the Caribbean and Latin American in general is constantly ravaged by war, disease, and corruption that continues unabated for almost a century.');

Lewis''s classic novel, the sequel to his even more classic "The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe." While it has some drippily allegorical moments near the end, Lewis does a pretty good job with what must have been a difficult sequel.When his aunt gives birth to a baby boy, young Prince Caspian finds himself on the run from his usurping uncle Miraz -- and in the hands of Narnia''s secret army of dwarves, centaurs, talking animals and nature spirits. Soon Caspian has an army backing his claim to the throne, but in a moment of desperation, he is forced to blow the magic horn of the legendary Queen Susan -- and subsequently pulls the Pevensies back into Narnia.But while only a year has passed on Earth, centuries have passed in Narnia, and the kids find that it''s no longer the place they left -- they and Aslan are distant memories, and their castle lies in ruins. And as they are led by a very skeptical dwarf to help Caspian, Lucy keeps glimpsing Aslan along the way -- a sign that things are about to change drastically in Narnia, both for the human and magical inhabitants...The Chronicles of Narnia were probably the first books to feature what is now standard in the fantasy genre -- an ordinary person gets dragged into another world. Just take a look at successful, unique authors like Diana Wynne Jones and Garth Nix to get an example of how Lewis'' stories have influenced the entire genre.If you don''t like allegory (religious or otherwise), then steer clear of "Prince Caspian," especially the second half. While Lewis''s beliefs are presented in a more complicated and subtle manner in his other fictional works, here the parallels to basic Christian beliefs are very obvious. Reportedly even Tolkien, one of Lewis''s best pals, found the allegory annoying.But if you can get past the slightly ham-handed treatment, it''s a lovely little read. Lewis interweaves mythical elements -- dwarves, nymphs, talking animals, witches -- with the chatty, slightly precious style of traditional British storytelling. But this one is a bit darker and more action-packed than "The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe," with some unexpected twists in the middle of it all. The scene with a strange witch and a werewolf is downright chilling, in fact.But Lewis'' plotting does sag near the end, during a drippy scene where Aslan wanders around fixing life for Narnian subjects. Fortunately after that, he gets back to a mystery that hangs over the whole book -- just where did all these humans come from, if they were such a rarity in the previous adventure?Peter seems a bit more jaded than before and Edmund a bit more mature, but sadly the girls don''t get enough to do this time around. But Caspian is a likable and believable prepubescent king-in-waiting, and surrounded by a bunch of unique Narnians -- a gentle yet fierce badger, a hostile dwarf, a fiery mouse, and the delightfully skeptical Trumpkin, who doesn''t believe in lions.Despite a few rough spots, "Prince Caspian" is a slightly darker, more intricate story, and its finale marks a turning point in the Chronicles of Narnia. Definitely give it a read before you see the movie.');

While it has some drippily allegorical moments near the end, Lewis does a pretty good job with what must have been a difficult sequel.When his aunt gives birth to a baby boy, young Prince Caspian finds himself on the run from his usurping uncle Miraz -- and in the hands of Narnia''s secret army of dwarves, centaurs, talking animals and nature spirits. Soon Caspian has an army backing his claim to the throne, but in a moment of desperation, he is forced to blow the magic horn of the legendary Queen Susan -- and subsequently pulls the Pevensies back into Narnia.But while only a year has passed on Earth, centuries have passed in Narnia, and the kids find that it''s no longer the place they left -- they and Aslan are distant memories, and their castle lies in ruins. And as they are led by a very skeptical dwarf to help Caspian, Lucy keeps glimpsing Aslan along the way -- a sign that things are about to change drastically in Narnia, both for the human and magical inhabitants...The Chronicles of Narnia were probably the first books to feature what is now standard in the fantasy genre -- an ordinary person gets dragged into another world. Just take a look at successful, unique authors like Diana Wynne Jones and Garth Nix to get an example of how Lewis'' stories have influenced the entire genre.If you don''t like allegory (religious or otherwise), then steer clear of "Prince Caspian," especially the second half. While Lewis''s beliefs are presented in a more complicated and subtle manner in his other fictional works, here the parallels to basic Christian beliefs are very obvious. Reportedly even Tolkien, one of Lewis''s best pals, found the allegory annoying.But if you can get past the slightly ham-handed treatment, it''s a lovely little read. Lewis interweaves mythical elements -- dwarves, nymphs, talking animals, witches -- with the chatty, slightly precious style of traditional British storytelling. But this one is a bit darker and more action-packed than "The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe," with some unexpected twists in the middle of it all. The scene with a strange witch and a werewolf is downright chilling, in fact.But Lewis'' plotting does sag near the end, during a drippy scene where Aslan wanders around fixing life for Narnian subjects. Fortunately after that, he gets back to a mystery that hangs over the whole book -- just where did all these humans come from, if they were such a rarity in the previous adventure?Peter seems a bit more jaded than before and Edmund a bit more mature, but sadly the girls don''t get enough to do this time around. But Caspian is a likable and believable prepubescent king-in-waiting, and surrounded by a bunch of unique Narnians -- a gentle yet fierce badger, a hostile dwarf, a fiery mouse, and the delightfully skeptical Trumpkin, who doesn''t believe in lions.Despite a few rough spots, "Prince Caspian" is a slightly darker, more intricate story, and its finale marks a turning point in the Chronicles of Narnia. Definitely give it a read before you see the movie.');

I think that this is best exemplified by this passage from the novel that occurs just after Tess has  informed Angel of the incident with Alec and the resulting pregnancy. It informs the legitimacy of the social and religious conventions that condemn Tess for that but excuse Angel for his two day sexual dalliance.<i><b> They had rambled round by a road which led to the well-known ruins of the Cisterican abbey behind teh mill, teh latter having, in centuries past, been attached to the monastic establishment. The mill still worked on, food being a perennial necessity; the abbey had perished; creeds being transient. One continually sees the ministration of the temporary outlasting the ministration of the eternal.</b></i>Tess is condemned and driven to her death by social and religious conventions. Hardy sees these as being transient and subject to great change even within a society. The novel is replete with references to differences in religious creed and how these foster intolerance - between high and low Anglicanism and with both to Roman Catholicism. The novel shows great  families falling into obscurity and other families assuming great histories to which they are not entitled. The conventions that enable these are not eternal. They are not inevitable. They have a beginning and they have an end. And yet, as Hardy shows, they claim the power to regulate the lives of human beings even to the point of condemnation. Tess is condemned  by a double standard that excuses the more powerful elements of a society. It is these social conventions  that Hardy identifies as transient and not eternal. he doubts their legitimacy. That is the main theme of the novel.');

For Pelagia Iannis the cost of transition is heavy.  Daughter of the village''s widower doctor, she is caught up in global forces beyond her ken.  The imperial ambitions of Italy''s dictator, Benito Mussolini, bring the Italian army of occupation.  Among the troops is Captain Antonio Corelli, artillery officer and musician.  An unwitting and hesitant imperial minion, he is billeted in the Iannis household.  Although the doctor urges passive resistance, Pelagia, although committed to a partisan youth, is drawn to Corelli''s musical talents and unworldly charm.  De Bernieres weaves an intricate tale of love, war, humour and pathos with unrivaled skill.  His characters sparkle with realism, an aspect permeating this outstanding work.  His descriptions of the interactions of the differing nationalities and ideologies ring vividly true.As he builds the story through the characters and events, de Bernieres gives little away.  There are continual surprises as events twist and bend the characters.  Some break, others find a means to extricate themselves from a tangling fate.  Pelagia bears the main burden throughout.  Her love for Corelli, after a fitful start, blossoms, then is tested by the swirl of events.  Other characters come into her life, remain or depart.  All make some impact as de Bernieres adroitly builds her role.  Each chapter becomes a minor tale in its own right, with all tied together flawlessly.  Characters and events are imparted with meticulous detail, yet, like a Mozart opera, not one word would bear excision.If you like a story that successfully ranges over a variety of issues and people, you will seek far and wide to surpass this tale.  De Bernieres'' skills in portraying life''s complexities, yet maintaining reader attention and interest are peerless.  He has clearly build his work on thorough scholarship - there''s even a source list at the end.  His sweeping view will leave you exhilarated and breathless, but fulfilled.

Such a masterful mix of comedy and tragedy is rare, indeed. In parts I couldn''t stop laughing, much to my sleeping husband''s annoyance as I read it late into  the night. Then unstoppable tears would flow. De Berniers''s obvious love of  his characters, his painstaking research, his use of challenging vocabulary  that often sent me gleefully into the dictionary, his masterful unfolding  of plot -- all combined to keep me in continual awe of his writing. And  now, about THAT ending: Yes, there was a definite shift from the intricate  details of most of the book, which covered a relatively short period of  time. But to cover decades in that same detailed style would be utterly  impossible! (Unless it becomes a multi-volume epic, which I believe in this  case would be unsustainable.) I was impressed, actually, that De Berniers  was able to give enough details to make the unfolding of those decades not  too rushed. It was like travelling on a speeding train through the  landscape, but stopping long enough in some places to get one''s bearings,  get a decent feel for the time and place, and even go into some shops and  have a nice meal and a chat with the locals. I LIKED the way De Berniers  constructed the "bridge", then, from the war to the present, to  what we can see and experience on the island of Cephalonia today. As far as  the culmination of the love-story is concerned, without giving away the  ending, I found it satisfying and realistic. The characters remained  essentially consistent, although circumstances and their lives had  drastically changed. The criteria for a good ending, as far as I''m  concerned, is that I feel satisfied, that it feels "right", and  that I couldn''t completely predict it, although some hints were pointing me  in that general direction. It met those criteria for me.');

The author cuts right to the chase in the second book of the Seventh Tower series, "Castle," by picking up where "The Fall" left off. Things get darker and tenser, and the mystery becomes even more twisted.Tal''s family is being mysteriously victimized, and will become outcasts unless he can get into the mystical land of Aenir. But now he''s captive of the Icecarls, and is the grudging ally of the tough wannabe-shieldmaiden Milla. After meeting with the ancient Mother Crone, Tal agrees to help sneak Milla in, so they can both find Sunstones -- he for his family, she for her people.But they have more trouble. After getting inside and consulting with Uncle Ebbitt, he tells them that they must find the Codex in Aenir. Then things take a hideous turn: The two kids are captured. Tal is imprisoned in the Pit -- and discovers something about his father''s fate. And Milla is trapped with the half-shadow-half-man monster Fashnek, in the Hall of Nightmares...Though "Castle" is not as strong as "Fall," it''s a darker, weirder story that adds to the mystery. Why does Sushin hate Tal and his family so much? What is happening to the Sunstones, if they''re dying and becoming useless? And who was the mysterious Longface, a Chosen taken in by the Icecarls -- what was he terrified of?Nix''s talent for fantastical horror is also more evident here, in the hideous Fashnek, who has an insectile shadow-claw over part of his body. While "Fall" was pretty much pure fantasy, "Castle" has the darker, more macabre bits -- probably even more as the series progresses. And his talent for creating familiar but alien cultures now extends to the Icecarls as well as the Chosen.Tal was a well-rounded character to start with, and he doesn''t disappoint in this book. Milla gets a bit more depth, and shows some liking for Tal and Uncle Ebbitt. She softens a little bit, while being no less tough. Uncle Ebbit is likably quirky, but more serious, and the Mother Crone is an intriguing old wisewoman.The second part of the "Seventh Tower" series is a little darker than the first book, and a little more of what fans expect from Nix. And he knows when to stop, just to make them dash eagerly for "Aenir."');

Milla, an Icecarl girl, is ordered to help Tal get back to the castle and, in return, get a new sunstone for her clan''s iceship.  In this book Tal and Milla get back to the castle only to find that Tal''s family is on the wrong side of a political power play.  Tal''s father disappeared in the first book and now his younger brother appears to have been kidnapped.  With his mother ill and his sister forced to live with a couple of very nasty relatives, Tal turns to his eccentric Great-Uncle Ebbitt for help.  After many narrow escapes, Tal and Milla enter the spirit word of the Chosen, of which Tal''s family are members, in order to find a book that may help them solve the mystery of Tal''s father''s disappearance.In the first book Nix tears down traditional gender roles.  He continues to do that in this book while at the same time rounding out the major characters personalities.  We begin to see more sides of both Tal and, especially, Milla.  In this book Nix also starts to address the cultural arrogance that both Tal and Milla have learned from their societies.  I think Nix has a great way of addressing some of the major social concerns of today''s society in an a manner that''s easily digestible for the intended age group for this book.  He does so with an intriguing and well written story.  I think that the book (and series) will appeal to both boys and girls since the both heros play an equal role in the story and both are dependent on the other equally for survival.  If fact, at the end of this book both Tal and Milla realize just that.I highly recommend this book.  It''s enlightening and it''s a terrific fantasy.');

They were beneficent to the population. The harm they brought was indirect, subtle and inevitable. This is not an action/adventure novel. it is a classic tragedy.The novel is based on the contrast between two characters - Nostromo, the title character, and Charles Gould. it is important that both of these characters are foreigners to the region - Nostromo - Genoese and Gould English as well as Costaguanan. It is also important that they go by multiple names Nostromo, Gian Battista, Captain Fidanza, and the Capitaz and Charles Gould as Don Carlos, Charles, Charley and the administrator of the San Tome mine. This is important because these names are not just different labels for the same persons but notifiers for personas that have markedly different social and personal implications. A major theme of this book is that the economic forces created by the new technologies introduced to the region affect the personalities of these characters. These impersonal forces change what they value and how they act. Both Gould and Nostromo become captives of the silver from the mines. They lose things that that are valuable in their lives. The things they value are changed. They do not do this by conscious choice but unconsciously with the impetus of these outside influences.The changes in Costaguna are beneficial and harmful at the same time. They bring peace and prosperity but the old community that existed there is inevitably lost. This is not an adventure novel. It is not a tale of fighting and daring-do. It is a novel in which the plot is moved forward within the description of characters. It is an analysis of the economic forces which shape values and which shapes how people live.

A novel of huge scope and political intrigue, it is also a novel in which no character actually wins.  All must accept the ironies which fate has dealt them.  Setting the novel in the imaginary South American country of Costaguana, the story centers around a silver mine in the mountains outside of the capital, Sulaco, vividly depicting its allure and the price each character pays for its success.When Charles Gould, returns from England to claim and reopen the rich silver mine he has inherited from his father, he has good intentions-- to provide jobs for the peasants and contribute to the economy of the town at the same time that he also profits.  Soon, however, he becomes obsessed with wealth and power, and as the political climate gets hotter, he must pay off government officials, bandits, the church, and various armed revolutionaries to be able to work.  Each of these groups is vividly depicted as working for its own ends and not for the good of the people, and with their goals focused on the real world, these characters have no self-awareness, nor do they develop it during the novel.In contrast to these "unrealized" humans, Conrad presents several characters who develop some self-awareness through their experiences.  Nostromo, a local legend, is a man of principle who has always kept his word.  Martin Decoud, a newspaper man, is a nihilist who has editorialized against the revolution, though he has yet to test himself.  Dr. Monygham, captured during a past revolution, broke under torture, and is now seeking absolution by fighting against this revolution. And the good and long-suffering wife of Charles Gould, Dona Emilia, who has lost her husband to his silver mine, now devotes her life to helping others.When Nostromo agrees to protect a load of silver from revolutionaries by taking it out to sea, he takes Decoud with him, leaving him on an island with the silver when they almost sink.  Decoud''s reaction to his isolation, and Nostromo''s reaction to the treasure that is suddenly "his," provide a dark commentary on idealism and human nature.  In the conclusion, which includes a love story that feels tacked on, Conrad''s darkest self is revealed, offering little hope of change and even less hope for man''s redemption.  Rich in atmosphere, vibrant in description, filled with characters representing all walks of life and philosophy, and set in a country where revolution is a way of life, the novel is full of dark portents and bleak political outcomes.

Alongside the larger group of natives and other people of color or lower class there is a small core group of Europeans, among those the Goulds.  In spite of being third generation South American Charles Gould still goes to England to find a wife.  Later when he decides to develop the silver mine he inherits from his father he goes to the United States to find a rich investor.  The silver mine becomes a huge success, only to become the target of political revolutionaries, and the story really begins when there is an attempted coup and takeover of the silver mine.  Much attention is given to inner conflicts and tough moral choices that individuals are forced to.Detailed descriptions of both characters and settings makes this novel quite a dense reading experience, particularly the first section which contains very little dialogue and reads like a documentary.  Only the final section of the novel seemed deserving of the title Nostromo, part one is about Costaguana, part two the Revolution and only in part three does the reader finally become fully acquainted with Gian'' Battista, or Nostromo as he is named by the upper class of Sulaco.');

This means that in place of his shadow he has a shadowguard, a shapshifting shadow that protects him from harm. In a few months he will have the chance to shed his shadowguard and bind himself to an adult shadowspirit. Unfortunately because of an unfortunate series of events Tal may not be able to receive a shadow spirit. You see he cannot go through the ceremony unless he has a primary sunstone and because his father has disappeared he has very few ways of receiving this sunstone. Even more serious is his mother''s health. Tal''s mother is very sick and the only thing that can help her is the light of a sunstone. Tal knows that if he doesn''t find a primary sunstone, chances are she will die. This sends young Tal out on a dangerous journey through the castle he lives in. He knows that he only has so much time and must do anything he can to receive this primary sunstone. Unfortunately people seem to be working against his quest to receive a sunstone. It looks like his only hope is to steal a sunstone, and the only way he can do that is to climb up the castle and penetrate the mysterious vale where the sunstones are stored.Garth Nix is probably best known for his dark YA series (starting with Sabriel) that takes you into a mysterious world known as the old Kingdom where the Abhorsen is peoples only protection against dangerous necromancers. The Fall, the first book of the Seven Towers series looks to have some things in common with Sabriel and it''s predecessors. It''s filled with fascinating characters and dark and mysterious creatures. It has a strong female character and a new and original world. The Castle is a mysterious place where what you''re class is means everything. Unfortunately, it''s not quite as gripping and addicting as Sabriel, possibly because it''s written in a much different style. The Seventh Tower series was made for a much younger audience so it doesn''t posses the enthralling descriptions and complex characterization as Sabriel. Still the book is very good. It''s fast paced, exciting, and interesting to read. Tal is a very amiable character.

The book is not beholden to the stereotypes of male strength and violence and  female compassion, as one typically finds.  Rather, both genders portray a  complete range of personalities; from the compassionate male hero to the  violent girl (Milla) that wants to kill Tal but resists out of loyalty to  her clan and because she gave her word to her clan''s (female) leader.  The  story line itself is interesting and shows no inconsistencies that leave  the reader wondering if the book was ever edited.  This the first book in a  total of six in the series.  My only complaint is that this book is not a  complete story in and of itself as are the Harry Potter books or Ursula Le  Guin''s Earthsea series.  It leaves the reader hanging at the end with no  idea of when part two will be written.  But that is a minor complaint and  inspite of that I highly recommend it.  In todays world it''s important that  boys have compassionate male heros and understand that females can be just  as violent as males.  Likewise, girls have to understand that boys aren''t  weak just because they aren''t physical and that girls can be strong both  physically and mentally.  Of course, the book also has it''s share of  underhanded people (both male and female) along with the snobs, the cheats,  the genius teetering on the edge of insanity and plenty of fantasy  creatures to round it out.  In short, as far as the characters go, the book  is an accurate portrayal of life.  And the story is a wonderful fantasy.');

As she and a junior Crone infiltrate the entryways, trying to get airweed, they encounter Free Shadows -- which are killed by the ancient Talon she acquired earlier. But when she rejoins the Freefolk, Milla finds that they have a traitor in their midst.Meanwhile, Tal is struggling to find the Empress so he can tell her of the conspiracy. But after a harrowing trip to Aenir, Tal finally finds her -- a doddering old woman with no real power to stop the evil Sushin. But then Tal discovers the horrendous creature that is manipulating Sushin -- and his own destiny.Garth Nix packs a lot of story into six slim books, and managed a fully realized fantasy world to boot. Not many authors can create as good a fantasy series in dozens of books. "Into Battle" has one weakness, but is otherwise a magnificent buildup to the series'' climax."Into Battle" also introduces us to the Big Bad Guy, Sharrakor. Not personally, not by bringing him onstage, but this is the first we hear of him; it''s a little jarring to have the sinister Sushin suddenly replaced as a top bad guy, this close to the end. Fortunately, Nix does sustain the sense of ominous mystery that this series has always had.And when he introduces us to the doddering empress and her equally doddering brother, Nix also hints at what''s in Tal''s future in this series, if he defeats Sushin and Sharrakor and doesn''t die in the process. Milla has already gained her destiny, and we see her as a humbler, more self-assured warrior than she was at the beginning."Into Battle" is a strong buildup to the final book of the Seventh Tower series, and proves again that Garth Nix has mastered the dark fantasy novel.
