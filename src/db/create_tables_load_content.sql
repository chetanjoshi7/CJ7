Set against the tragic love of Anna and Vronsky, the plight of the melancholy nobleman Konstantine Levin unfolds.  In doubt about the meaning of life, haunted by thoughts of suicide, Levin’s struggles echo Tolstoy’s own spiritual crisis.  But Anna''s inner turmoil mirrors the own emotional imprisonment and mental disintegration of a woman who dares to transgress the strictures of a patriarchal world.  In Anna Karenina, Leo Tolstoy brought to perfection the novel of social realism and created a masterpiece that bared the Russian soul.');

The great masterpiece in ten books, the Republic, concerns righteousness (and involves education, equality of the sexes, the structure of society, and abolition of slavery). Of the six so-called dialectical dialogues Euthydemus deals with philosophy; metaphysical Parmenides is about general concepts and absolute being; Theaetetus reasons about the theory of knowledge. Of its sequels, Sophist deals with not-being; Politicus with good and bad statesmanship and governments; Philebus with what is good. The Timaeus seeks the origin of the visible universe out of abstract geometrical elements. The unfinished Critias treats of lost Atlantis. Unfinished also is Plato''s last work of the twelve books of Laws (Socrates is absent from it), a critical discussion of principles of law which Plato thought the Greeks might accept.The Loeb Classical Library edition of Plato is in twelve volumes.');

In Memoirs of a Geisha, we enter a world where appearances are paramount; where a girl''s virginity is auctioned to the highest bidder; where women are trained to beguile the most powerful men; and where love, always elusive, is scorned as illusion.  Sayuri''s story begins in a poor fishing village in 1929, when, as a nine-year-old with unusual blue-gray eyes, she is taken from her home and sold into slavery to a renowned geisha house. Through her eyes, we see the decadent heart of Gion--the geisha district of Kyoto--with its marvelous teahouses and theaters, narrow back alleys, ornate temples, and artists'' streets. And we witness her transformation as she learns the rigorous arts of the geisha: dance and music; wearing kimono, elaborate makeup and hair; pouring sake to reveal just a touch of inner wrist; competing with a jealous rival for men''s solicitude and the money that goes with it. But as World War II erupts and the geisha houses are forced to close, Sayuri, with little money and even less food, must reinvent herself all over again to find a rare kind of freedom on her own terms.Memoirs of a Geisha is a book of nuances and vivid metaphor, of memorable characters rendered with humor and pathos. And though the story is rich with detail and a vast knowledge of history, it is the transparent, seductive voice of Sayuri that the reader remembers.

Now, in A Feast for Crows, Martin delivers the long-awaited fourth book of his landmark series, as a kingdom torn asunder finds itself at last on the brink of peace . . . only to be launched on an even more terrifying course of destruction.A FEAST FOR CROWSIt seems too good to be true. After centuries of bitter strife and fatal treachery, the seven powers dividing the land have decimated one another into an uneasy truce. Or so it appears. . . . With the death of the monstrous King Joffrey, Cersei is ruling as regent in King’s Landing. Robb Stark’s demise has broken the back of the Northern rebels, and his siblings are scattered throughout the kingdom like seeds on barren soil. Few legitimate claims to the once desperately sought Iron Throne still exist—or they are held in hands too weak or too distant to wield them effectively. The war, which raged out of control for so long, has burned itself out. But as in the aftermath of any climactic struggle, it is not long before the survivors, outlaws, renegades, and carrion eaters start to gather, picking over the bones of the dead and fighting for the spoils of the soon-to-be dead. Now in the Seven Kingdoms, as the human crows assemble over a banquet of ashes, daring new plots and dangerous new alliances are formed, while surprising faces—some familiar, others only just appearing—are seen emerging from an ominous twilight of past struggles and chaos to take up the challenges ahead. It is a time when the wise and the ambitious, the deceitful and the strong will acquire the skills, the power, and the magic to survive the stark and terrible times that lie before them. It is a time for nobles and commoners, soldiers and sorcerers, assassins and sages to come together and stake their fortunes . . . and their lives.

It is intended for use at the introductory graduate level. A distinguishing feature of the book is its integration of specialrelativity into teaching of classical mechanics. After a thorough review of the traditional theory, Part II of the book introduces extended Lagrangian and Hamiltonian methods that treat time as a transformable coordinate rather than the fixed parameter of Newtonian physics. Advanced topics such ascovariant Langrangians and Hamiltonians, canonical transformations, and Hamilton-Jacobi methods are simplified by the use of this extended theory. And the definition of canonical transformation no longer excludes the Lorenz transformation of special relativity.This is also a book for those who study analytical mechanics to prepare for a critical exploration of quantum mechanics. Comparisons to quantum mechanics appear throughout the text. The extended Hamiltonian theory with time as a coordinate is compared to Dirac''s formalism of primary phase spaceconstraints. The chapter on relativistic mechanics shows how to use covariant Hamiltonian theory to write the Klein-Gordon and Dirac equations. The chapter on Hamilton-Jacobi theory includes a discussion of the closely related Bohm hidden variable model of quantum mechanics.Classical mechanics itself is presented with an emphasis on methods, such as linear vector operators and dyadics, which will familiarize the student with similar techniques in quantum theory. Several of the current fundamental problems in theoretical physics - the development of quantum informationtechnology, and the problem of quantizing the gravitational field, to name two - require a rethinking of the quantum-classical connection.

Although the novel was a commercial failure and out of print at the time of the author''s death in 1891, its reputation grew immensely during the twentieth century. D. H. Lawrence called it "one of the strangest and most wonderful books in the world," and "the greatest book of the sea ever written." Moby-Dick is considered a Great American Novel and an outstanding work of the Romantic period in America and the American Renaissance. "Call me Ishmael" is one of world literature''s most famous opening sentences. The product of a year and a half of writing, the book is dedicated to Nathaniel Hawthorne, "in token of my admiration for his genius," and draws on Melville''s experience at sea, on his reading in whaling literature, and on literary inspirations such as Shakespeare and the Bible. The detailed and realistic descriptions of whale hunting and of extracting whale oil, as well as life aboard ship among a culturally diverse crew, are mixed with exploration of class and social status, good and evil, and the existence of God. In addition to narrative prose, Melville uses styles and literary devices ranging from songs, poetry and catalogs to Shakespearean stage directions, soliloquies and asides. The author changed the title at the very last moment in September 1851. The work first appeared as The Whale in London in October 1851, and then under its definitive title Moby-Dick in New York in November. The whale, however, appears in both the London and New York editions as "Moby Dick," with no hyphen. The British edition of five hundred copies was not reprinted during the author''s life, the American of almost three thousand was reprinted three times at approximately 250 copies, the last reprinting in 1871.

And, indeed, it seems as though that dream is destined to come to pass — because one day, under sudden and enigmatic circumstances, he finds himself in possession of "great expectations." In telling Pip''s story, Dickens traces a boy''s path from a hardscrabble rural life to the teeming streets of 19th-century London, unfolding a gripping tale of crime and guilt, revenge and reward, and love and loss. Its compelling characters include Magwitch, the fearful and fearsome convict; Estella, whose beauty is excelled only by her haughtiness; and the embittered Miss Havisham, an eccentric jilted bride.Written in the last decade of Dickens'' life, Great Expectations was praised widely and universally admired. It was his last great novel, and many critics believe it to be his finest. Readers and critics alike praised it for its masterful plot, which rises above the melodrama of some of his earlier works, and for its three-dimensional, psychologically realistic characters — characters much deeper and more interesting than the one-note caricatures of earlier novels. "In none of his other works," wrote the reviewer in the 1861 Atlantic, "does he evince a shrewder insight into real life, and a cheaper perception and knowledge of what is called the world." To Swinburne, the novel was unparalleled in all of English fiction, with defects "as nearly imperceptible as spots on the sun or shadows on a sunlit sea." Shaw found it Dickens'' "most completely perfect book." Now this inexpensive edition invites modern readers to savor this timeless masterpiece, teeming with colorful characters, unexpected plot twists, and Dickens'' vivid rendering of the vast tapestry of mid-Victorian England.');

But the very qualities that set Dorothea apart from the materialistic, mean-spirited society around her also lead her into a disastrous marriage with a man she mistakes for her soul mate. In a parallel story, young doctor Tertius Lydgate, who is equally idealistic, falls in love with the pretty but vain and superficial Rosamund Vincy, whom he marries to his ruin. &&LP&&REliot surrounds her main figures with a gallery of characters drawn from every social class, from laborers and shopkeepers to the rising middle class to members of the wealthy, landed gentry. Together they form an extraordinarily rich and precisely detailed portrait of English provincial life in the 1830s. But Dorothea’s and Lydgate’s struggles to retain their moral integrity in the midst of temptation and tragedy remind us that their world is very much like our own. Strikingly modern in its painful ironies and psychological insight, &&LI&&RMiddlemarch&&L/I&&R was pivotal in the shaping of twentieth-century literary realism. &&L/P&&R&&LP&&R&&LB&&RLynne Sharon Schwartz&&L/B&&R is the author of fourteen books of fiction, non-fiction, and poetry, including the novels &&LI&&RDisturbances in the Field, Leaving Brooklyn&&L/I&&R, and &&LI&&RIn the Family Way&&L/I&&R, and the memoir &&LI&&RRuined by Reading&&L/I&&R.

The authors take great care to meet both these objectives, because this organization will allow instructors teaching from this text to stay on task so that each topic can be covered with the depth required before progressing to the next logical one. As a result the reader is prepared for each new unit and there is no need to repeat a concept in a subsequent chapter when it is utilized. This text is geared towards an introductory linear algebra course taken by first or second year undergraduate students. However, it offers the opportunity to introduce the importance of abstraction, not only in mathematics, but in many other areas where Linear Algebra is used. The textbooks approach is to take advantage of this opportunity by presenting abstract vector spaces as early as possible. Throughout the text, the authors are mindful of the difficulties that students at this level have with abstraction and introduce new conceptsfirst through examples which gently illustrate the idea. To motivate the definition of an abstract vector space, and the subtle concept of linear independence, the authors use addition and scalar multiplication of vectors in Euclidean Space. The authors have strived to create a balance between computation, problem solving, and abstraction. This approach equips students with the necessary skills and problem solving strategies in an abstract setting that allows for a greater understanding and appreciation for the numerous applications of the subject.');

After examining the logical structure of propositions and the nature of logical inference, he discusses the theory of knowledge as well as principles of physics and ethics and aspects of the mystical.Supervised by the author himself, this translation from the German by C.

But the Society he faithfully served was built on lies. Darrow’s kind have been betrayed and denied by their elitist masters, the Golds—and their only path to liberation is revolution. And so Darrow sacrifices himself in the name of the greater good for which Eo, his true love and inspiration, laid down her own life. He becomes a Gold, infiltrating their privileged realm so that he can destroy it from within.   A lamb among wolves in a cruel world, Darrow finds friendship, respect, and even love—but also the wrath of powerful rivals. To wage and win the war that will change humankind’s destiny, Darrow must confront the treachery arrayed against him, overcome his all-too-human desire for retribution—and strive not for violent revolt but a hopeful rebirth. Though the road ahead is fraught with danger and deceit, Darrow must choose to follow Eo’s principles of love and justice to free his people.   He must live for more.Praise for Golden Son  “Gripping . . . Both author and lead character have cranked up the emotional stakes. . . . With Golden Son, Brown avoids the sophomore slump, charging the novel with the kind of dystopia-toppling action you’d expect in a trilogy ender, not a middle volume. On virtually every level, this is a sequel that hates sequels—a perfect fit for a hero who already defies the tropes. [Grade:] A”—Entertainment Weekly  “Stirring . . . Comparisons to The Hunger Games and Game of Thrones series are inevitable, for this tale has elements of both.”—Kirkus Reviews“Brown writes layered, flawed characters . . . but plot is his most breathtaking strength. . . . Every action seems to flow into the next.”—NPR“It’s a far superior sequel, in fact: one of the rare breed of reads that improves upon its predecessor in every conceivable category. . . . In a word, Golden Son is stunning. Never mind how little we’ve seen of 2015: Among science fiction fans, it should be a shoo-in for book of the year.”—Tordotcom “The stakes are even higher than they were in Red Rising, and the twists and turns of the story are every bit as exciting. The jaw-dropper of an ending will leave readers hungry for the conclusion to Brown’s wholly original, completely thrilling saga.”—Booklist (starred review)    “Dramatic . . . the rare middle book that loses almost no momentum as it sets up the final installment.”—Publishers Weekly');

Meanwhile, the magical barriers that keep Fillory safe are failing, and barbarians from the north have invaded. Eliot and Janet, the rulers of Fillory, embark on a final quest to save their beloved world, only to discover a situation far more complex—and far more dire—than anyone had envisioned.Along with Plum, a brilliant young magician with a dark secret of her own, Quentin sets out on a crooked path through a magical demimonde of gray magic and desperate characters. His new life takes him back to old haunts, like Antarctica and the Neitherlands, and old friends he thought were lost forever. The Magician’s Land is an intricate and fantastical thriller, and an epic of love and redemption that brings the Magicians trilogy to a magnificent conclusion, confirming it as one of the great achievements in modern fantasy.');

And Reacher is hit with two pieces of shocking news, one with serious criminal consequences, and one too personal to even think about.   When threatened, you can run or fight.   Reacher fights, aiming to find Turner and clear his name, barely a step ahead of the army, and the FBI, and the D.C. Metro police, and four unidentified thugs.   Combining an intricate puzzle of a plot and an exciting chase for truth and justice, Lee Child puts Reacher through his paces—and makes him question who he is, what he’s done, and the very future of his untethered life on the open road.Praise for Never Go Back   “A breathless cross-country spree . . . some of the best, wiliest writing [Lee] Child has ever done . . . Child’s bodacious action hero, Jack Reacher, has already tramped through 17 novels and three e-book singles. But his latest, Never Go Back, may be the best desert island reading in the series. It’s exceptionally well plotted. And full of wild surprises. And wise about Reacher’s peculiar nature. And positively Bunyanesque in its admiring contributions to Reacher lore.”—Janet Maslin, The New York Times   “Welcome to the relentless world of Jack Reacher and his impressive tendency to be in the wrong place at the right time. . . . Child has created an iconic character that other thriller writers try to emulate but don’t come close to matching. He has a talent for taking material that in the hands of other authors would be stale and making it seem fresh. . . . Tight and compelling . . . Never Go Back is one of Child’s best novels.”—Associated Press  “An adrenaline-charged, action-packed thriller . . . impossible to put down.”—Lansing State Journal   “The dialogue has never been sharper. . . . The pages turn themselves.”—San Antonio Express-News“For the pure pleasure of uncomplicated, nonstop action, no one touches Reacher.”—Kirkus Reviews (starred review)   “Brilliant . . . Child never, ever slips. He keeps the action cranking better than anyone, but, best of all, he keeps us guessing about Reacher.”—Booklist (starred review)   “One of the best in the series.”—Publishers Weekly (starred review)');

But no one will tell him. It’s a tiny place hidden in a thousand square miles of wheat fields, with a railroad stop, and sullen and watchful people, and a worried woman named Michelle Chang, who mistakes him for someone else: her missing partner in a private investigation she thinks must have started small and then turned lethal. Reacher has no particular place to go, and all the time in the world to get there, and there’s something about Chang . . . so he teams up with her and starts to ask around. He thinks: How bad can this thing be? But before long he’s plunged into a desperate race through LA, Chicago, Phoenix, and San Francisco, and through the hidden parts of the internet, up against thugs and assassins every step of the way—right back to where he started, in Mother’s Rest, where he must confront the worst nightmare he could imagine. Walking away would have been easier. But as always, Reacher’s rule is: If you want me to stop, you’re going to have to make me.Praise for Make Me “Child’s Reacher series has hit Book No. 20 with a resounding peal of wisecracking glee.

Maybe there’s something wrong with me. But I can’t wait for the twenty-first.”—Malcolm Gladwell, The New Yorker “[The Reacher series] is the current gold standard in the genre. . . . In Make Me Lee Child delivers another Jack Reacher specialty; the total knockout.”—Dayton Daily News “Child serves up wingding plots, pithy dialogue, extraordinary background on intriguing topics, and cunningly constructed suspense. But what keeps us coming back—by the millions—is the chance to walk around in the skin of that big guy in the middle of everything.”—The Oregonian “A dark thriller . . . Lee Child’s Make Me, the twentieth in his wildly popular Jack Reacher series, delivers exactly what readers have come to expect from the perennial bestselling author: interesting characters, tight plots and page-turning action. . . . Readers won’t be disappointed.”—Minneapolis Star Tribune “Jack Reacher is back. . . . Readers new to this series will find this book a good starting point, and fans will be pleased to see Jack again.”—LibraryReads (Top Ten Pick) “The reigning champ ups the ante.”—Booklist (starred review)');

Now in his middle years, Dodge appreciates his comfortable, unencumbered life, managing his myriad business interests, and spending time with his beloved niece Zula and her young daughter, Sophia. One beautiful autumn day, while he undergoes a routine medical procedure, something goes irrevocably wrong. Dodge is pronounced brain dead and put on life support, leaving his stunned family and close friends with difficult decisions. Long ago, when a much younger Dodge drew up his will, he directed that his body be given to a cryonics company now owned by enigmatic tech entrepreneur Elmo Shepherd. Legally bound to follow the directive despite their misgivings, Dodge’s family has his brain scanned and its data structures uploaded and stored in the cloud, until it can eventually be revived. In the coming years, technology allows Dodge’s brain to be turned back on. It is an achievement that is nothing less than the disruption of death itself.

Former great civilizations had become extinct, but aware of the fate which lay before them had reached out, leaving Time Capsules for a new race to find, designed to help them in the development. The new race of people, because of their retained affinity with the sea called themselves the Waterborn. Highly intelligent and with telepathic powers the Time Capsules did accelerate the growth and the building of their civilization. Another civilization was taking an interest in the Waterborn, not from Earth but this was the most highly developed race in the Universe. It was not the first time they had visited Earth, leader of their early society known as the Immortals had lived on Earth thousands of years before and were known as the Gods. With the support of a space traveling civilization millions of years old, the Waterborn thrived, eventually becoming space travelers as well. Hundreds of years later, the Empire received a call from Earth. Planet Earth was destroying itself from within. The entire civilization was rescued and resettled on a planet which had just gone through catastrophic events which had wiped out more than half of their population. From these chaotic beginnings the Waterborn matured as a civilization and began taking vital roles in the Greater Empire.

Excerpt Tonrack activated the remote which brought the fighter to them and they were about to board, when he stopped them. Zeus said gently, a statement more than a question, “there is another.” Tonrack nodded, there must be, he said, “Those we killed were undoubtedly magicians and adepts, but none of them had the power to erect those psychic barriers we met when coming down through the atmosphere.” He led them into the fighter and told them first to search the craft to make sure no-one had concealed themselves aboard, that done, he lay down on his bed, and told them, as soon as he had left his body, they were to leave the planet and maintain a safe orbit for two hours, if he had not returned by then, they were to call in the fleet, and turn the planet into charred rock. He held Tersova for a moment, reached out and briefly grasped the hands of both Zeus and Athena, then cast himself into a self-induced trance. He had to do this quickly. Because he was facing a deadly enemy, far stronger than those before, and he would try to get an advantage before Tonrack could get his bearings. Rather than waiting until he had become the usual replica of himself, he assumed the form of the Dragon. The only difference this time was, the dragon form he assumed was that of his mentor, and as he did so, he knew the Dragon was there with him. He literally leapt out of his body as the fighter lifted off and soared high into the atmosphere. He had been right, the mage had as much power as he had, and had been waiting for him. As he emerged a dark shape passed him. Had he been slower, he would have been dealt a devastating blow. The magician had also assumed the form of a dragon. A huge black beast with two massively muscled hind legs and its arms were its wings; the ends of each of its elongated fingers were vicious claws. The speed of his exit, not only protected him, it also put him above his foe. This dragon was an ice dragon, and its icy breath could neutralize his fire.

Reacher takes a stroll through a small Wisconsin town and sees a class ring in a pawn shop window: West Point 2005. A tough year to graduate: Iraq, then Afghanistan. The ring is tiny, for a woman, and it has her initials engraved on the inside. Reacher wonders what unlucky circumstance made her give up something she earned over four hard years. He decides to find out. And find the woman. And return her ring. Why not? So begins a harrowing journey that takes Reacher through the upper Midwest, from a lowlife bar on the sad side of small town to a dirt-blown crossroads in the middle of nowhere, encountering bikers, cops, crooks, muscle, and a missing persons PI who wears a suit and a tie in the Wyoming wilderness. The deeper Reacher digs, and the more he learns, the more dangerous the terrain becomes. Turns out the ring was just a small link in a far darker chain.

Now, as the brutal struggle for power nears its tumultuous climax, the battered and divided kingdom faces its most terrifying invasion—one that is being spearheaded from beyond the grave. . . .A STORM OF SWORDSOf the five contenders for power, one is dead, another in disfavor, and still the wars rage as violently as ever, as alliances are made and broken. Joffrey, of House Lannister, sits on the Iron Throne, the uneasy ruler of the land of the Seven Kingdoms. His most bitter rival, Lord Stannis, stands defeated and disgraced, the victim of the jealous sorceress who holds him in her evil thrall. But young Robb, of House Stark, still rules the North from the fortress of Riverrun. Robb plots against his despised Lannister enemies, even as they hold his sister hostage at King''s Landing, the seat of the Iron Throne. Meanwhile, making her way across a blood-drenched continent is the exiled queen, Daenerys, mistress of the only three dragons still left in the world. Filled with the stench of death and decay from the destructive dynastic war, Daenerys is gathering allies and strength for an assault on King''s Landing, hoping to win back the crown she believes is rightfully hers. But as opposing forces maneuver for the final titanic showdown, an army of barbaric wildlings bent on overwhelming the Seven Kingdoms arrives from the outermost line of civilization.

Much of the work deals with ideas such as the "eternal recurrence of the same," the parable on the "death of God," and the "prophecy" of the Übermensch, which were first introduced in The Gay Science.The book chronicles the fictitious travels and speeches of Zarathustra. Zarathustra''s namesake was the founder of Zoroastrianism, usually known in English as Zoroaster (Avestan: Zaraϑustra). Nietzsche is clearly portraying a "new" or "different" Zarathustra, one who turns traditional morality on its head.Zarathustra has a simple characterization and plot, narrated sporadically throughout the text. It possesses a unique experimental style, one that is, for instance, evident in newly invented "dithyrambs" narrated or sung by Zarathustra. Likewise, the separate Dithyrambs of Dionysus was written in autumn 1888, and printed with the full volume in 1892, as the corollaries of Zarathustra''s "abundance."Some speculate that Nietzsche intended to write about final acts of creation and destruction brought about by Zarathustra. However, the book lacks a finale to match that description; its actual ending focuses more on Zarathustra recognizing that his legacy is beginning to perpetuate, and consequently choosing to leave the higher men to their own devices in carrying his legacy forth.');

Russell discusses various aspects of socialist-communist and syndicalist thought, and applies them to the various portions of civil society. Beginning with an examination of the history of the political theories and their potential for success, Russell proposes a sort of ''guild socialism'' whereby workers are organized into different groupings and specialisms, as opposed to the centralized, bureaucratic system advocated by state socialism.  Although Russell believes that the socialist system would be the closest to perfection, he does not believe that it would be entirely lacking of flaws. Furthermore, Russell attributes many problems of the theory as solvable over time; a fine-tuning of the technical implementation of socialist economics would, so the author proposes, iron out the problems and inefficiencies in the system.  A lifelong socialist, Russell believed that the correct implementation of left-wing theory could result in the greatest possible amount of happiness and prosperity among a given country''s citizens.

Ender''s GameWinner of the Hugo and Nebula AwardsIn order to develop a secure defense against a hostile alien race''s next attack, government agencies breed child geniuses and train them as soldiers. A brilliant young boy, Andrew "Ender" Wiggin lives with his kind but distant parents, his sadistic brother Peter, and the person he loves more than anyone else, his sister Valentine. Peter and Valentine were candidates for the soldier-training program but didn''t make the cut―young Ender is the Wiggin drafted to the orbiting Battle School for rigorous military training.Ender''s skills make him a leader in school and respected in the Battle Room, where children play at mock battles in zero gravity. Yet growing up in an artificial community of young soldiers Ender suffers greatly from isolation, rivalry from his peers, pressure from the adult teachers, and an unsettling fear of the alien invaders. His psychological battles include loneliness, fear that he is becoming like the cruel brother he remembers, and fanning the flames of devotion to his beloved sister. Is Ender the general Earth needs? But Ender is not the only result of the genetic experiments. The war with the Buggers has been raging for a hundred years, and the quest for the perfect general has been underway for almost as long. Ender''s two older siblings are every bit as unusual as he is, but in very different ways. Between the three of them lie the abilities to remake a world.

And it is only the Speaker for the Dead, who is also Ender Wiggin the Xenocide, who has the courage to confront the mystery...and the truth.XenocideThe war for survival of the planet Lusitania will be fought in the hearts of a child named Gloriously Bright.On Lusitania, Ender found a world where humans and Pequeninos and the Hive Queen could all live together; where three very different intelligent species could find common ground at last. Or so he thought.Lusitania also harbors the descolada, a virus that kills all humans it infects, but which the Pequeninos require in order to become adults. The Starways Congress so fears the effects of the descolada, should it escape from Lusitania, that they have ordered the destruction of the entire planet, and all who live there. The Fleet is on its way, a second xenocide seems inevitable.Children of the MindThe planet Lusitania is home to three sentient species: the Pequeninos; a large colony of humans; and the Hive Queen, brought there by Ender. But once against the human race has grown fearful; the Starways Congress has gathered a fleet to destroy Lusitania.Jane, the evolved computer intelligence, can save the three sentient races of Lusitania. She has learned how to move ships outside the universe, and then instantly back to a different world, abolishing the light-speed limit. But it takes all the processing power available to her, and the Starways Congress is shutting down the Net, world by world.Soon Jane will not be able to move the ships.

Wells first published “The Invisible Man” in 1897, the title alone ensured its success. Invisibility fascinates, attracts, and terrifies. It’s allure rests in the ability to escape notice (and with it criticism, self-consciousness, and the power of the other’s gaze), to be freed from social pressures (to be pretty, dress well, be polite, stay put, etc.), and to have the freedom to enter any unlocked space without challenge. An invisible person can eavesdrop and learn new information, can quietly monitor the behavior of loved ones, and can behave the way they want to without fear of attracting immediate notice. There is a liberating feeling behind this attraction: a longing to escape criticism and evade disapproval. Who disapproves of the table manners, posture, or fashion choices of an invisible man? The fantasy lies in the ability to be unshackled from the weight of self-consciousness, and levitated out of our own shame and embarrassment by proxy. Since its publication, “The Invisible Man” has offered a fascinating glimpse into the psychology of a sociopath, and the overwhelming power of rage. At its simplest it is an engrossing example of science fiction that envisions the frightening possibilities of technology: to simultaneously become all powerful and utterly vulnerable (something we understand all too well in the Digital Age). At its most complex it is a potent parable of social Darwinism reversed: the high-flying genius whose arrogance, egotism, and misanthropy leave him flung so far from the reach of his fellow man that he is devoured by his own narcissism. It is a lesson in pride as much as it is a fantasy of possibilities – a study in self-control as much as it is a dream of self-potential. Invisibility continues to fascinate us: the ability to blend in and avoid criticism is impossibly attractive. But we know all too well the horror that it can bring: the paranoia of observation, the vulnerability of voyeurism, and the insecurity of exposure. But perhaps it is the Invisible Man himself who experiences the ultimate human horror – anonymity – an idea that begins to dawn on him as he finds himself friendless, fatherless, and reviled by every person he encounters. Ultimately this is the terror of an invisible man, regardless of the perspective: to enter unnoticed, to see unseen, to be missing but unmissed.');

The ship is transporting a number of animals which belong to Montgomery. As they approach the island, Montgomery''s destination, the captain demands Prendick leave the ship with Montgomery. Montgomery explains that he will not be able to host Prendick on the island. Despite this, the captain leaves Prendick in a dinghy and sails away.

While we know that nature follows patterns—such as the law of gravity—our everyday lives are beyond what known science can predict. We nevertheless muddle through even in the absence of theories of how to act. But how do we do it?In Probably Approximately Correct, computer scientist Leslie Valiant presents a masterful synthesis of learning and evolution to show how both individually and collectively we not only survive, but prosper in a world as complex as our own. The key is “probably approximately correct” algorithms, a concept Valiant developed to explain how effective behavior can be learned. The model shows that pragmatically coping with a problem can provide a satisfactory solution in the absence of any theory of the problem. After all, finding a mate does not require a theory of mating. Valiant''s theory reveals the shared computational nature of evolution and learning, and sheds light on perennial questions such as nature versus nurture and the limits of artificial intelligence.Offering a powerful and elegant model that encompasses life''s complexity, Probably Approximately Correct has profound implications for how we think about behavior, cognition, biological evolution, and the possibilities and limits of human and machine intelligence.');

About Beyond Good and Evil by Friedrich Nietzsche  Beyond Good and Evil: Prelude to a Philosophy of the Future (German: Jenseits von Gut und Böse: Vorspiel einer Philosophie der Zukunft) is a book by philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche, first published in 1886.It draws on and expands the ideas of his previous work, Thus Spoke Zarathustra, but with a more critical and polemical approach.In Beyond Good and Evil, Nietzsche accuses past philosophers of lacking critical sense and blindly accepting dogmatic premises in their consideration of morality. Specifically, he accuses them of founding grand metaphysical systems upon the faith that the good man is the opposite of the evil man, rather than just a different expression of the same basic impulses that find more direct expression in the evil man. The work moves into the realm "beyond good and evil" in the sense of leaving behind the traditional morality which Nietzsche subjects to a destructive critique in favour of what he regards as an affirmative approach that fearlessly confronts the perspectival nature of knowledge and the perilous condition of the modern individual.');

As one crewmember''s past seems connected to the current trouble, Jason must decide what side of the fight he''s on ... let the ConFed die and plunge the quadrant into chaos, or swallow his pride and try to help an institution he despises maintain its power for the greater good.');

On a country road deep in the New England woods, he sees a sign to a place he has never been: the town where his father was born. He thinks, What’s one extra day? He takes the detour.

But their respite will be short-lived. In the Badlands, deep in the haunted vastness of pre-Cataclysmic space, a new discovery threatens to upset the balance of power. Orbiting a world in a distant system is an ancient battleship, vastly larger and enormously more advanced than anything possessed by the contending powers…and the Union has already sent forces to seize it. The Confederation has no ships close enough to intervene, to get there before the enemy…none save Dauntless. Barron and his crew must race across the Badlands, find the ancient artifact, and somehow hold it, keep the Union forces from taking it, until reinforcements arrive. They will be outnumbered and outgunned, but there can be no retreat. Not this time. Nothing less than the fate of all human-inhabited space is at stake. If the Confederation is able to rediscover the technology of the ancients, it will be safe for generations to come, its defensive forces untouchable by its enemies. But if the Union gets there first, if it can adapt the incredible power of mankind’s lost technology, it will gain the power to enslave all humanity. This fight isn’t for territory. It isn’t for position or tactical advantage. It is for the future.');

Set against the tragic love of Anna and Vronsky, the plight of the melancholy nobleman Konstantine Levin unfolds.  In doubt about the meaning of life, haunted by thoughts of suicide, Levin’s struggles echo Tolstoy’s own spiritual crisis.  But Anna''s inner turmoil mirrors the own emotional imprisonment and mental disintegration of a woman who dares to transgress the strictures of a patriarchal world.  In Anna Karenina, Leo Tolstoy brought to perfection the novel of social realism and created a masterpiece that bared the Russian soul.', 10.84, 223);

Linguistic tests including those of computer science still try to establish the order of his extant philosophical dialogues, written in splendid prose and revealing Socrates'' mind fused with Plato''s thought.In Laches, Charmides, and Lysis, Socrates and others discuss separate ethical conceptions. Protagoras, Ion, and Meno discuss whether righteousness can be taught. In Gorgias, Socrates is estranged from his city''s thought, and his fate is impending. The Apology (not a dialogue), Crito, Euthyphro, and the unforgettable Phaedo relate the trial and death of Socrates and propound the immortality of the soul. In the famous Symposium and Phaedrus, written when Socrates was still alive, we find the origin and meaning of love. Cratylus discusses the nature of language. The great masterpiece in ten books, the Republic, concerns righteousness (and involves education, equality of the sexes, the structure of society, and abolition of slavery).

In Memoirs of a Geisha, we enter a world where appearances are paramount; where a girl''s virginity is auctioned to the highest bidder; where women are trained to beguile the most powerful men; and where love, always elusive, is scorned as illusion.  Sayuri''s story begins in a poor fishing village in 1929, when, as a nine-year-old with unusual blue-gray eyes, she is taken from her home and sold into slavery to a renowned geisha house. Through her eyes, we see the decadent heart of Gion--the geisha district of Kyoto--with its marvelous teahouses and theaters, narrow back alleys, ornate temples, and artists'' streets. And we witness her transformation as she learns the rigorous arts of the geisha: dance and music; wearing kimono, elaborate makeup and hair; pouring sake to reveal just a touch of inner wrist; competing with a jealous rival for men''s solicitude and the money that goes with it. But as World War II erupts and the geisha houses are forced to close, Sayuri, with little money and even less food, must reinvent herself all over again to find a rare kind of freedom on her own terms.Memoirs of a Geisha is a book of nuances and vivid metaphor, of memorable characters rendered with humor and pathos.

It is intended for use at the introductory graduate level. A distinguishing feature of the book is its integration of specialrelativity into teaching of classical mechanics. After a thorough review of the traditional theory, Part II of the book introduces extended Lagrangian and Hamiltonian methods that treat time as a transformable coordinate rather than the fixed parameter of Newtonian physics. Advanced topics such ascovariant Langrangians and Hamiltonians, canonical transformations, and Hamilton-Jacobi methods are simplified by the use of this extended theory. And the definition of canonical transformation no longer excludes the Lorenz transformation of special relativity.This is also a book for those who study analytical mechanics to prepare for a critical exploration of quantum mechanics. Comparisons to quantum mechanics appear throughout the text. The extended Hamiltonian theory with time as a coordinate is compared to Dirac''s formalism of primary phase spaceconstraints. The chapter on relativistic mechanics shows how to use covariant Hamiltonian theory to write the Klein-Gordon and Dirac equations. The chapter on Hamilton-Jacobi theory includes a discussion of the closely related Bohm hidden variable model of quantum mechanics.Classical mechanics itself is presented with an emphasis on methods, such as linear vector operators and dyadics, which will familiarize the student with similar techniques in quantum theory. Several of the current fundamental problems in theoretical physics - the development of quantum informationtechnology, and the problem of quantizing the gravitational field, to name two - require a rethinking of the quantum-classical connection. Graduate students preparing for research careers will find a graduate mechanics course based on this book to be an essential bridge between their undergraduatetraining and advanced study in analytical mechanics, relativity, and quantum mechanics.', 118.78, NULL);

Although the novel was a commercial failure and out of print at the time of the author''s death in 1891, its reputation grew immensely during the twentieth century. D. H. Lawrence called it "one of the strangest and most wonderful books in the world," and "the greatest book of the sea ever written." Moby-Dick is considered a Great American Novel and an outstanding work of the Romantic period in America and the American Renaissance. "Call me Ishmael" is one of world literature''s most famous opening sentences. The product of a year and a half of writing, the book is dedicated to Nathaniel Hawthorne, "in token of my admiration for his genius," and draws on Melville''s experience at sea, on his reading in whaling literature, and on literary inspirations such as Shakespeare and the Bible. The detailed and realistic descriptions of whale hunting and of extracting whale oil, as well as life aboard ship among a culturally diverse crew, are mixed with exploration of class and social status, good and evil, and the existence of God. In addition to narrative prose, Melville uses styles and literary devices ranging from songs, poetry and catalogs to Shakespearean stage directions, soliloquies and asides. The author changed the title at the very last moment in September 1851. The work first appeared as The Whale in London in October 1851, and then under its definitive title Moby-Dick in New York in November. The whale, however, appears in both the London and New York editions as "Moby Dick," with no hyphen.

And, indeed, it seems as though that dream is destined to come to pass — because one day, under sudden and enigmatic circumstances, he finds himself in possession of "great expectations." In telling Pip''s story, Dickens traces a boy''s path from a hardscrabble rural life to the teeming streets of 19th-century London, unfolding a gripping tale of crime and guilt, revenge and reward, and love and loss. Its compelling characters include Magwitch, the fearful and fearsome convict; Estella, whose beauty is excelled only by her haughtiness; and the embittered Miss Havisham, an eccentric jilted bride.Written in the last decade of Dickens'' life, Great Expectations was praised widely and universally admired. It was his last great novel, and many critics believe it to be his finest. Readers and critics alike praised it for its masterful plot, which rises above the melodrama of some of his earlier works, and for its three-dimensional, psychologically realistic characters — characters much deeper and more interesting than the one-note caricatures of earlier novels. "In none of his other works," wrote the reviewer in the 1861 Atlantic, "does he evince a shrewder insight into real life, and a cheaper perception and knowledge of what is called the world." To Swinburne, the novel was unparalleled in all of English fiction, with defects "as nearly imperceptible as spots on the sun or shadows on a sunlit sea."

The authors take great care to meet both these objectives, because this organization will allow instructors teaching from this text to stay on task so that each topic can be covered with the depth required before progressing to the next logical one. As a result the reader is prepared for each new unit and there is no need to repeat a concept in a subsequent chapter when it is utilized. This text is geared towards an introductory linear algebra course taken by first or second year undergraduate students. However, it offers the opportunity to introduce the importance of abstraction, not only in mathematics, but in many other areas where Linear Algebra is used. The textbooks approach is to take advantage of this opportunity by presenting abstract vector spaces as early as possible. Throughout the text, the authors are mindful of the difficulties that students at this level have with abstraction and introduce new conceptsfirst through examples which gently illustrate the idea. To motivate the definition of an abstract vector space, and the subtle concept of linear independence, the authors use addition and scalar multiplication of vectors in Euclidean Space. The authors have strived to create a balance between computation, problem solving, and abstraction. This approach equips students with the necessary skills and problem solving strategies in an abstract setting that allows for a greater understanding and appreciation for the numerous applications of the subject.', 57.45, NULL);

Now in his middle years, Dodge appreciates his comfortable, unencumbered life, managing his myriad business interests, and spending time with his beloved niece Zula and her young daughter, Sophia. One beautiful autumn day, while he undergoes a routine medical procedure, something goes irrevocably wrong. Dodge is pronounced brain dead and put on life support, leaving his stunned family and close friends with difficult decisions. Long ago, when a much younger Dodge drew up his will, he directed that his body be given to a cryonics company now owned by enigmatic tech entrepreneur Elmo Shepherd. Legally bound to follow the directive despite their misgivings, Dodge’s family has his brain scanned and its data structures uploaded and stored in the cloud, until it can eventually be revived. In the coming years, technology allows Dodge’s brain to be turned back on. It is an achievement that is nothing less than the disruption of death itself. An eternal afterlife—the Bitworld—is created, in which humans continue to exist as digital souls. But this brave new immortal world is not the Utopia it might first seem . . .

Griffin, newcomer R.E. McDermott is back with another action-packed adventure. DUGAN THOUGHT SOMALI PIRATES WERE BAD NEWS. THEN IT GOT WORSE. As Tom Dugan and Alex Kairouz, his partner and best friend, struggle to ransom their ship and crew from murderous Somali pirates, things take a turn for the worse. A US Navy contracted tanker with a full load of jet fuel is also hijacked, not by garden variety pirates, but by terrorists with links to Al Qaeda, changing the playing field completely. With a possible link between piracy and terrorism now in play, the US and British goverments order the halt of all negotiations for captive ships, and enraged pirates ratchet up the mistreatment of the captive crews. When one of their crewman is murdered in front of him on a live video feed, a frustrated Dugan takes matters into his own hands and starts his own rescue operation, only to stumble across something far more sinister — a rogue salvage operation for a long lost weapon of mass destruction. Isolated at sea on an old tanker previously destined for the ship breakers, Dugan and his hastily assembled little force of Russian mercenaries find themselves the last line of defense between the world and a terrifying bio-weapon. Weaving historical fact with speculative fiction, Deadly Coast takes the reader from London board rooms into the very real world of modern day pirates — and their victims.', 21.02, 19);

Reacher takes a stroll through a small Wisconsin town and sees a class ring in a pawn shop window: West Point 2005. A tough year to graduate: Iraq, then Afghanistan. The ring is tiny, for a woman, and it has her initials engraved on the inside. Reacher wonders what unlucky circumstance made her give up something she earned over four hard years. He decides to find out. And find the woman. And return her ring. Why not? So begins a harrowing journey that takes Reacher through the upper Midwest, from a lowlife bar on the sad side of small town to a dirt-blown crossroads in the middle of nowhere, encountering bikers, cops, crooks, muscle, and a missing persons PI who wears a suit and a tie in the Wyoming wilderness. The deeper Reacher digs, and the more he learns, the more dangerous the terrain becomes. Turns out the ring was just a small link in a far darker chain. Powerful forces are guarding a vast criminal enterprise. Some lines should never be crossed. But then, neither should Reacher.Praise for The Midnight Line “Puts Reacher just where we want him.”—The New York Times Book Review“A gem.”—Chicago Tribune “A timely, suspenseful, morally complex thriller, one of the best I’ve read this year . . .

Former great civilizations had become extinct, but aware of the fate which lay before them had reached out, leaving Time Capsules for a new race to find, designed to help them in the development. The new race of people, because of their retained affinity with the sea called themselves the Waterborn. Highly intelligent and with telepathic powers the Time Capsules did accelerate the growth and the building of their civilization. Another civilization was taking an interest in the Waterborn, not from Earth but this was the most highly developed race in the Universe. It was not the first time they had visited Earth, leader of their early society known as the Immortals had lived on Earth thousands of years before and were known as the Gods. With the support of a space traveling civilization millions of years old, the Waterborn thrived, eventually becoming space travelers as well. Hundreds of years later, the Empire received a call from Earth. Planet Earth was destroying itself from within. The entire civilization was rescued and resettled on a planet which had just gone through catastrophic events which had wiped out more than half of their population. From these chaotic beginnings the Waterborn matured as a civilization and began taking vital roles in the Greater Empire. Call of a Dragon follows members of this remarkable race and their colleagues in their adventures and dedication to the protection and expansion of the Empire. As they face diabolical threats and fight powers from the Dark Side, they find help from unlikely sources. Against tremendous odds those of the Waterborn Saga help to shape the Universe of the future. Excerpt Tonrack activated the remote which brought the fighter to them and they were about to board, when he stopped them. Zeus said gently, a statement more than a question, “there is another.” Tonrack nodded, there must be, he said, “Those we killed were undoubtedly magicians and adepts, but none of them had the power to erect those psychic barriers we met when coming down through the atmosphere.” He led them into the fighter and told them first to search the craft to make sure no-one had concealed themselves aboard, that done, he lay down on his bed, and told them, as soon as he had left his body, they were to leave the planet and maintain a safe orbit for two hours, if he had not returned by then, they were to call in the fleet, and turn the planet into charred rock. He held Tersova for a moment, reached out and briefly grasped the hands of both Zeus and Athena, then cast himself into a self-induced trance. He had to do this quickly. Because he was facing a deadly enemy, far stronger than those before, and he would try to get an advantage before Tonrack could get his bearings. Rather than waiting until he had become the usual replica of himself, he assumed the form of the Dragon. The only difference this time was, the dragon form he assumed was that of his mentor, and as he did so, he knew the Dragon was there with him. He literally leapt out of his body as the fighter lifted off and soared high into the atmosphere. He had been right, the mage had as much power as he had, and had been waiting for him. As he emerged a dark shape passed him. Had he been slower, he would have been dealt a devastating blow. The magician had also assumed the form of a dragon. A huge black beast with two massively muscled hind legs and its arms were its wings; the ends of each of its elongated fingers were vicious claws. The speed of his exit, not only protected him, it also put him above his foe. This dragon was an ice dragon, and its icy breath could neutralize his fire.

Much of the work deals with ideas such as the "eternal recurrence of the same," the parable on the "death of God," and the "prophecy" of the Übermensch, which were first introduced in The Gay Science.The book chronicles the fictitious travels and speeches of Zarathustra. Zarathustra''s namesake was the founder of Zoroastrianism, usually known in English as Zoroaster (Avestan: Zaraϑustra). Nietzsche is clearly portraying a "new" or "different" Zarathustra, one who turns traditional morality on its head.Zarathustra has a simple characterization and plot, narrated sporadically throughout the text. It possesses a unique experimental style, one that is, for instance, evident in newly invented "dithyrambs" narrated or sung by Zarathustra. Likewise, the separate Dithyrambs of Dionysus was written in autumn 1888, and printed with the full volume in 1892, as the corollaries of Zarathustra''s "abundance."Some speculate that Nietzsche intended to write about final acts of creation and destruction brought about by Zarathustra. However, the book lacks a finale to match that description; its actual ending focuses more on Zarathustra recognizing that his legacy is beginning to perpetuate, and consequently choosing to leave the higher men to their own devices in carrying his legacy forth.', 9.08, NULL);

Russell discusses various aspects of socialist-communist and syndicalist thought, and applies them to the various portions of civil society.

Although Russell believes that the socialist system would be the closest to perfection, he does not believe that it would be entirely lacking of flaws. Furthermore, Russell attributes many problems of the theory as solvable over time; a fine-tuning of the technical implementation of socialist economics would, so the author proposes, iron out the problems and inefficiencies in the system.  A lifelong socialist, Russell believed that the correct implementation of left-wing theory could result in the greatest possible amount of happiness and prosperity among a given country''s citizens.

G. Wells first published “The Invisible Man” in 1897, the title alone ensured its success. Invisibility fascinates, attracts, and terrifies. It’s allure rests in the ability to escape notice (and with it criticism, self-consciousness, and the power of the other’s gaze), to be freed from social pressures (to be pretty, dress well, be polite, stay put, etc.), and to have the freedom to enter any unlocked space without challenge. An invisible person can eavesdrop and learn new information, can quietly monitor the behavior of loved ones, and can behave the way they want to without fear of attracting immediate notice. There is a liberating feeling behind this attraction: a longing to escape criticism and evade disapproval. Who disapproves of the table manners, posture, or fashion choices of an invisible man? The fantasy lies in the ability to be unshackled from the weight of self-consciousness, and levitated out of our own shame and embarrassment by proxy. Since its publication, “The Invisible Man” has offered a fascinating glimpse into the psychology of a sociopath, and the overwhelming power of rage. At its simplest it is an engrossing example of science fiction that envisions the frightening possibilities of technology: to simultaneously become all powerful and utterly vulnerable (something we understand all too well in the Digital Age). At its most complex it is a potent parable of social Darwinism reversed: the high-flying genius whose arrogance, egotism, and misanthropy leave him flung so far from the reach of his fellow man that he is devoured by his own narcissism. It is a lesson in pride as much as it is a fantasy of possibilities – a study in self-control as much as it is a dream of self-potential. Invisibility continues to fascinate us: the ability to blend in and avoid criticism is impossibly attractive. But we know all too well the horror that it can bring: the paranoia of observation, the vulnerability of voyeurism, and the insecurity of exposure. But perhaps it is the Invisible Man himself who experiences the ultimate human horror – anonymity – an idea that begins to dawn on him as he finds himself friendless, fatherless, and reviled by every person he encounters. Ultimately this is the terror of an invisible man, regardless of the perspective: to enter unnoticed, to see unseen, to be missing but unmissed.', 19.76, NULL);

While we know that nature follows patterns—such as the law of gravity—our everyday lives are beyond what known science can predict. We nevertheless muddle through even in the absence of theories of how to act. But how do we do it?In Probably Approximately Correct, computer scientist Leslie Valiant presents a masterful synthesis of learning and evolution to show how both individually and collectively we not only survive, but prosper in a world as complex as our own. The key is “probably approximately correct” algorithms, a concept Valiant developed to explain how effective behavior can be learned. The model shows that pragmatically coping with a problem can provide a satisfactory solution in the absence of any theory of the problem. After all, finding a mate does not require a theory of mating. Valiant''s theory reveals the shared computational nature of evolution and learning, and sheds light on perennial questions such as nature versus nurture and the limits of artificial intelligence.Offering a powerful and elegant model that encompasses life''s complexity, Probably Approximately Correct has profound implications for how we think about behavior, cognition, biological evolution, and the possibilities and limits of human and machine intelligence.', 18.1, NULL);

About Beyond Good and Evil by Friedrich Nietzsche  Beyond Good and Evil: Prelude to a Philosophy of the Future (German: Jenseits von Gut und Böse: Vorspiel einer Philosophie der Zukunft) is a book by philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche, first published in 1886.It draws on and expands the ideas of his previous work, Thus Spoke Zarathustra, but with a more critical and polemical approach.In Beyond Good and Evil, Nietzsche accuses past philosophers of lacking critical sense and blindly accepting dogmatic premises in their consideration of morality. Specifically, he accuses them of founding grand metaphysical systems upon the faith that the good man is the opposite of the evil man, rather than just a different expression of the same basic impulses that find more direct expression in the evil man. The work moves into the realm "beyond good and evil" in the sense of leaving behind the traditional morality which Nietzsche subjects to a destructive critique in favour of what he regards as an affirmative approach that fearlessly confronts the perspectival nature of knowledge and the perilous condition of the modern individual.', 8.0, NULL);

Jack Reacher hits the pavement and sticks out his thumb. He plans to follow the sun on an epic trip across America, from Maine to California. He doesn’t get far. On a country road deep in the New England woods, he sees a sign to a place he has never been: the town where his father was born. He thinks, What’s one extra day? He takes the detour. At the same moment, in the same isolated area, a car breaks down. Two young Canadians had been on their way to New York City to sell a treasure. Now they’re stranded at a lonely motel in the middle of nowhere. The owners seem almost too friendly. It’s a strange place, but it’s all there is. The next morning, in the city clerk’s office, Reacher asks about the old family home. He’s told no one named Reacher ever lived in town. He’s always known his father left and never returned, but now Reacher wonders, Was he ever there in the first place?  As Reacher explores his father’s life, and as the Canadians face lethal dangers, strands of different stories begin to merge. Then Reacher makes a shocking discovery: The present can be tough, but the past can be tense . . . and deadly.Praise for Past Tense “Child is one writer who should never be taken for granted.”—The New York Times Book Review “[Lee Child] shows no signs of slowing down. . . .

INSERT INTO public."Reviews" (review_id, user_id, book_id, rating, review) VALUES (382, 483, 33, 5, 'If you can remember playing "Adventure"  on a teletype, this book is for you.  And if you''re in college, hoping for a job in computing when you graduate, this book is for you too.  It''s an anarchic compendium  of the anarchic vocabulary, habits, and style of the programming  profession.The New Hacker''s Dictionary is mostly arranged as a set of  alphabetical entries, but there are a couple of excellent appendices, on  hacker folklore and on the hacker lifestyle and habits.  (Hacker is used  here in its original sense of someone who enjoys and is good at  programming--Raymond has included both "hacker" and  "cracker" as entries, of course.)  The entry on folklore is  simply hilarious; I wish I could just include Guy Steele''s "more  magic" story here, but I''ll just have to tell you to buy the  book.The entries are a real mixture.  Many, such as "indent  style", go beyond just defining the term: this entry gives examples of  the four major C styles and mentions the holy wars (another entry . . .)  which have occurred over them.  Some are quite current: Easter egg, kluge,  Trojan horse; others are arcane or dated, but still interesting: NeWS,  CP/M, chiclet keyboard.  All the entries are interesting and  well-written.Newcomers to the field may find a good deal of  enlightenment here, and old-timers will find a lot of memories.  My own  favourite entries relate to the old text-based game Adventure, which I  encountered on a CDC machine in 1981.  "I see no <X> here."  "Plugh!"  "Xyzzy!"  *Sigh*  It almost makes me miss  those old teletypes.');
INSERT INTO public."Reviews" (review_id, user_id, book_id, rating, review) VALUES (383, 484, 33, 4, 'Perhaps we should start by telling what this dictionary isn''t. First, it has nothing to do with breaking into computer systems and similar illegal activities which any layman would usually associate with hackers. It teaches you that hacking is not the correct name for breaking into computers, though. Second, it is not a dictionary of IT terminology. You can probably do your IT job quite well without knowing what a foobar is. And third, it is not a dictionary of the current cyber slang. The main reason for this is probably the fact that Eric Raymond is well beyond his teenage years.Altogether, I don''t even think The New Hacker''s Dictionary fits the category of a reference work. Instead I''d dare to call it literature in the form of a dictionary, much like the classical Devil''s Dictionary by Ambrose Bierce, or The Meaning of Liff by Douglas Adams. Sure, many entries can be used as reference, although a lot of them actually refer to historic software and hardware items like ITS, PDP-10 or LISP machines. The New Hacker''s Dictionary not the dry, encyclopedic style of dictionary - entries are written in an opinionated, juicy style. The humorous side of the dictionary - a work of a witty, creative hacker mind picking names for things - certainly vastly outweighs its practical side.So is this book for you? Yes, if the legendary MIT AI lab hacker scene fascinates you. Although LISP machines are gone, it''s perhaps still affecting your computing environment more than you think. For example: Linux, the free Unix clone, is built on top of the GNU project, which descends directly from the MIT AI lab hacker scene. And finally, is there any point in buying a printed book, if the complete text is available on Raymond''s web site so you can read it on-line?  I''d say it is. You see, it''s not particularly convenient to take your computer into the bath tub.');
INSERT INTO public."Reviews" (review_id, user_id, book_id, rating, review) VALUES (384, 485, 33, 5, 'This book gives some great insight into the mind of the hacker. And note hacker, NOT cracker! Hackers are unjustly maligned by the media as being evil types who just want to wreak havoc on big business and government computer systems, when in reality they view breaking in on security systems as a hobby and almost always alert the authorities to the system break-in.This dictionary of hacker terms (which can be hilarious, informative, or esoteric depending on their meaning) gives an idea of the creativity and mentality of the hackers and their distrust of huge corporations (ie "Broken Windows" for Sun''s "Open Windows," "Windoze" for Microsoft Windows, and so on). Reading though the definition of terms gives you an idea of how to "talk turkey" with said hackers, and even if I will always be just a "wannabe" hacker, it helps to be able to get an idea of the mindset of the hacker.At the back of the book, there''s even a brief compilation of hacker "folklore" and "legends," a portrait of a "typical hacker," and ways to help the hacker culture grow (like getting a free Unix system or contributing to organizations like the Free Software Foundation).Books like this one, The Cathedral and the Bazaar, and Open Sources give an excellent view of the hacker culture.');

I used this lively introduction to probability in class and I found it a pleasure to read it.

I''m not a scholar or academic at all but this book is on the list of books to read before you die and it''s a classic so I wanted to read it.I have to say I loved the basic story about Anna, and also about the other characters but there were portions of this book that were painful to get through. I''m sure if I had studied Russia or Russian literature those parts would have been very interesting. Most of it seems to be social commentary on the ideals of the time...and farming...lots and lots of farming! These sections slowed the book down for me and that''s why it''s four stars and not five. Although I am working with a limited IQ quite frankly, and so this assessment is more a failing on my own part, and not that of the book.I did enjoy it very much. It has a lot to say about women and their place in society and how double standards applied to Anna but not to Vronsky because of what they''d done. Something that we can still relate to somewhat today. Women are typically shamed for their sexual behavior where as men are not. Tolstoy showed this beautifully and I really felt for Anna.');

It is written as if you can feel what each of the characters feel and you know them inside and out. This novel is very thorough and complete to the very end. It is an intresting love story from a different time, with a very different society. I enjoyed how the writer not only tells you about the love story of Anna, but of many others as well. The novel is a great mix of history,love, society, economical changes towards their futures and social differences for men and women of the time.');

This book by Leo Tolstoy is particularly interesting since it mirrors his own life (he is, basically, the character, Levin).  The characters are emotional, the historical element is intriguing and the setting of Russia in her glory days all combine to make this one of the best classical novels (in my opinion).  I think the element of a book that makes it most appealing is when one can''t put it down and this book certainly qualifies - despite its length.');

I thought that the previous two books were excellent, but this final one blew away my expectations. It was a tremendously engaging read--like many people I often use the phrase "couldn''t put it down", but this time it was true. Karen Traviss created an incredibly human, believable, compelling ensemble of characters for the trilogy and she outdid herself with her writing this time. Even the artificial intelligence she wrote, Black-Box, comes across as more human and relatable than the protagonists of many other bestselling novels I''ve read, and I dare say some of the people that I actually know.While the past Halo books were fun expansions of the games'' universe with bits of history, world-building, and action, this trilogy--and especially Mortal Dictata--went far deeper than that. Mortal Dictata is a beautiful, deep exploration of morality, justice, and what it means to be human, at a level that I never expected out of the Halo novels (and I say that as an avid reader and fan of them) and it has earned a position as one of my three favourite books. It gives us a look at the minds of people who have done great things and terrible things to ensure the survival of the human race through a brutal war, and brings us along for the ride as they deal with the consequences of those actions.If you need a reason to read this book, it is this: Mortal Dictata asks us how far is too far to go when extinction is a real and immediate threat; if it being a novel based on a game series makes you think it won''t make you question not only your views on the subject, but the very notion of there being a right answer, I assure you that it will when it shows you--side by side and in vivid, living colour--the benefits and the human costs of actions taken for the greater good.');

Her writing is clear, rich, and engaging, and completely free of errors...which some of the other authors works were filled with.

The prequel doesn''t interest me as it only sums up what happened before the tale of Thomas and the Gladers and features all new characters. No thanks.The first book in the series is the soon-to-be-in-theatres, movie adapted version of the book, The Maze Runner.Synopsis from Goodreads:"If you ain''t scared, you ain''t human."When Thomas wakes up in the lift, the only thing he can remember is his name. He''s surrounded by strangers--boys whose memories are also gone.Outside the towering stone walls that surround the Glade is a limitless, ever-changing maze. It''s the only way out--and no one''s ever made it through alive.Then a girl arrives. The first girl ever. And the message she delivers is terrifying.---While reading it, I was constantly very annoyed with the flow of writing; James Dashner''s unpolished writing and repetitiveness continued to bother me throughout this book and the entire series. His writing distracted me so much that it really took away from the book. I also found the novel quite boring, yet promising, but it constantly left me waiting in anticipation and disappointing me later on. I always refer to The Maze Runner as a book that would do well as a movie; the plot is intriguing and unique and they would strip away the irrelevant things and might even make it better than the book.The Scorch Trials, the second book in the series, I found more enticing.Synopsis from Goodreads:Solving the Maze was supposed to be the end.Thomas was sure that escape from the Maze would mean freedom for him and the Gladers. But WICKED isn’t done yet. Phase Two has just begun. The Scorch.There are no rules. There is no help. You either make it or you die.The Gladers have two weeks to cross through the Scorch—the most burned-out section of the world. And WICKED has made sure to adjust the variables and stack the odds against them.Friendships will be tested. Loyalties will be broken. All bets are off.There are others now. Their survival depends on the Gladers’ destruction—and they’re determined to survive.---I had originally planned to not continue the series as The Maze Runner didn''t satisfy me enough - or at least wait until I have time to read it - but I had someone tell me that I MUST continue; that James Dashner offers so much more in the last two books. I decided to take a chance and commit to the second book. It was definitely an improvement; it seemed as if Dashner was trying to appeal to an older audience as the gore and violence would be a little too much for a pre-teen, in my opinion. Some scenes were very graphic, but that made it all the more interesting. It was a lot more intriguing and kept me reading, excited for what would happen next as their lives continued to be in impending danger. New characters were introduced, loyalties were questioned, and a new problem was brought to the Gladers'' attention, bringing them closer to the truth.Last, but not least, The Death Cure.Synopsis on Goodreads:Thomas knows that Wicked can''t be trusted, but they say the time for lies is over, that they''ve collected all they can from the Trials and now must rely on the Gladers, with full memories restored, to help them with their ultimate mission. It''s up to the Gladers to complete the blueprint for the cure to the Flare with a final voluntary test.What Wicked doesn''t know is that something''s happened that no Trial or Variable could have foreseen. Thomas has remembered far more than they think. And he knows that he can''t believe a word of what Wicked says.The time for lies is over. But the truth is more dangerous than Thomas could ever imagine.Will anyone survive the Death Cure?---The improvement from The Scorch Trials dissipated, I guess, because this book reminded me of The Maze Runner; it lacked excitement, was promising, yet disappointing, and I was disappointed, but the writing has improved at least. There''s some action within the book that will have you on your toes, but you will reel back easily without even a skipped heartbeat. There wasn''t enough intensity in the novel until, basically, the very end. Things get intense then. Other than that, it didn''t excite me enough. The characters spent a lot of time running back and forth and a character is mentioned in The Scorch Trials and in The Death Cure that only receives the light of day at the conclusion of the novel. All finales are rushed though, they can''t help it.I believe the series as a whole was...good. Just "good". It is a series worth reading and many will enjoy it, but I wouldn''t call it my favourite series. If they were each individual books and not part of a series, I''d say read the Scorch Trials, but as a whole series, I don''t know. I''d probably say something like "The Maze Runner was okay, I guess, but The Scorch Trials was really good! The Death Cure was kind of boring." Also, the series as a whole was confusing; in each book, there was a new reason for WICKED''s methods. It was just too much information, he should have just picked one.Overall, it''s a good series. I would recommend it; I''m sure many will like it, and I absolutely cannot wait to see the movies! They should be amazing! It may not be the best series, but they''re worth reading. It brings a fresh, never before seen, idea to the bookshelves. Well, I''ve never read anything like it, but I don''t know for sure if there''s absolutely nothing like it. Anyways, enjoy, try to look past his writing style and you should be fine. And what I mean by his writing style, I am mainly talking about his fragmented sentences. For example, he would write something like this: "He screamed his throat raw, called for help."....................................................................................................................yeah. He does it constantly throughout the series. If you see nothing wrong with that sentence, then you should be able to enjoy the series.');

He was Professor of Medieval and Renaissance Literature at Cambridge, where he counted J.R.R. Tolkien among his friends. "The Horse and his Boy", the third book of the Chronicles of Narnia, was first published in 1954.Although the series is known as the "Chronicles of Narnia", much of the action takes place in the neighbouring countries of Calormen and Archenland. Shasta, the boy mentioned in the book''s title, is introduced first - he''s been brought up in Calormen by a fisherman called Arsheesh. One evening, a local prince stops with the pair and demands hospitality. Later, when Shasta overhears the prince and his father bartering for Shasta himself, he decides to run away. Luckily for Shasta, the prince''s horse is a captured Narnian horse called Bree - and, as a Narnian, Bree can talk. Bree has also set his heart on escaping and returning home and agrees to take Shasta with him - recognising the boy as either a fellow Narnian or an Archenlander, rather than being native to Calormen. The pair make off together that night and, before long, they are joined on the road by another fleeing pair : Aravis and Hwin. Aravis is a Calormen princess being forced to marry against her will while Hwin, like Bree, is a captured Narnian horse. The four escapees must make their way through Calormen''s capital, Tashbaan, and then across the northern desert to safety.It''s possible I''m seeing more in this book than was intended, and I know it''s supposed to be a kid''s book - but I''d have to describe the portrayal of Calormen''s people as not only the book''s big flaw but also very questionable. Physically, they''re described as having dark faces and wear turbans, while their favoured weapon is the scimitar. As individuals, only Aravis is portrayed in anything vaguely resembling a positive light. Arsheesh, Shasta''s foster-father, had no qualms about selling him into slavery, while Aravis'' father was apparently happy to arrange her man to the Grand Vizier - someone old enough to be her grandfather. Meanwhile, the Tisroc - Calormen''s ruler - is the sort of cheap and easy villain others have tried to fabricate again more recently : he actually sneers at the concept of freedom. Narnia''s King Edmund and Queen Susan also appear briefly - Queen Lucy''s appearance is barely even fleeting. Edmund, who didn''t exactly cover himself in glory in "The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe", maintains his low standards when his refers to Prince Rabadash as Susan''s "dark faced lover". He isn''t long in adding that Rabadash is "proud, bloody, luxurious, cruel and a self-pleasing tyrant". (From only a slightly different perspective, of course, the very same thing could be said about Peter - Narnia''s High King and Edmund''s brother).

The tale takes place during the time period just before the end of "The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe," (roughly during the start of "Wardrobe''s" last chapter) and is largely independent of the other six Narnia books. All of the Narnia books can be read independently, but "Horse" in particular has little link to the others.The tale is a classic "young person escapes a bad life" story, and in the end becomes a classic "downtrodden young person saves the day" and a "young person of meager background is" - well, that would be giving something away. Time-tested clichés of the genre, to be sure, but not clichés in a bad way. In Lewis'' tale, this is a Good Thing. Because it works.The story concerns Shasta, a young boy, and a talking horse, Bree, who flee their evil masters in an attempt to reach the free land of Narnia to the north. In their flight they meet up with Aravis, a young girl also fleeing with a talking horse, Hwin. They adventure their way through the country of Calormen, a thinly-veiled substitute for the Middle Eastern countries of the real world.Like the best of children''s literature, the pacing is brisk and the obstacles to be overcome are introduced quickly and almost without pause.As in all the Narnia books, we are introduced to Aslan. This time Aslan''s role initially seems minor, but is revealed to have retroactively been a major role. It is among the worst uses of the lion in the series. Much of what the lions tells Shasta feel dreadfully like the famous poem "Footsteps," in which Jesus explains to a walker looking at his life traced in footsteps on the beach that those moments when there were but one set of footsteps, not two for the walker and Jesus, were moments when Jesus carried the walker through life, not the walker walking through his troubles alone. In "Horse," it slaps the reader from the story. Worse still is the fact that the entire meeting with Aslan is written in a gratingly worshipful tone that is horribly jarring; it does the story a great disservice. The scene, however, is mercifully short.Because "The Horse and His Boy" is a side adventure in Narnia more than anything else, it does not have as strong a connection, and therefore sentimental tug, as the rest of the books. Still, heavy-handed Aslan scene aside, "Horse" is a delightfully simple adventure about young people escaping a bad situation. Escapism is almost never a bad thing, especially for younger people who prefer to read over playing video games, and Lewis does it very well. Most readers will thoroughly enjoy this, even if it isn''t essential Narnia.');

Despite the title of the book, there are a smattering of female characters in some of the tales.  They rank with the standard fare of impetuous women that Hemingway likes to write about.The scope of the stories is quite broad, featuring painful topics such as abortion, breakup, heartbreak and being past ones prime.  The latter theme is taken up in THE UNDEFEATED,  THE KILLERS and FIFTY GRAND and later on re-appears in Hemingway''s THE OLD MAN AND THE SEA.  FIFTY GRAND, which details the demise of a washed-up boxer, is my favorite short story in this collection.Stories such as IN ANOTHER COUNTRY, and NOW I LAY ME introduce motifs that are echoed in A FAREWELL TO ARMS, which was published just a few years after MWW.Tho I''ve never been enamoured with the short story genre, Hemingway does rank as one of the best in the business - particularly in the American literary canon.

While incomplete as stories, they give insight into the creative process. Insofar as the stories Hemingway did publish, some are quite good: "Ten Indians", a story of adolescent love, rejection, and the resiliency of the teenage mind; "The Battler", a wonderful portrayal of mental illness among drifters and hobos; and "Fathers and Sons", a death meditation.Other stories, such as the famous "Big Two Hearted River" and "The Killers" are just not very good. What is the significance of "Big Two Hearted River" consisting of two parts? Beats the hell of me. And the entire story is about nothing but the rituals of fishing and camping, which Hemingway describes to the point of fetishization. There is something at the very end about the swamp being a "tragic" place to fish, but that there will be another time to confront it. Don''t be so obscure, Hem. What are you talking about? We''ll never know because the story is devoid as to what''s on Nick''s mind (See footnote below). And then "The Killers" is implausible: contract killers are not ingenue who intentionally leave evidence trails and toss out incriminating statements; and witnesses do call the cops.What I notice about all of the stories is that Hemingway mostly focuses on external things, and that little or nothing of the characters'' inner lives is revealed. Because details of hunting, fishing and camping are interesting to a point only, ultimately, I lose interest. Hemingway''s style is also annoying: he was too much the reporter and not enough the poet. Because he never sings, very little description is unique or memorable.We must remember that these stories were written and published in the 1920s and 1930s. At that time Art Deco - simple, unadorned, streamlined - was popluar. Perhaps Hemingway, like many great artists, subconsciously intuited the zeitgeist, or spirit of the time, and reflected that in his writing. Hemingway''s style and substance now seem dated. But at one time, like Art Deco, they were revolutionary. Perhaps that explains Hemingway''s once extraordinary popularity which seems incomprehensible now.FOOTNOTE: I have since discovered that such obscurity was intentional and evidently first applied during the writing of this story. Hemingway describes this literary device in "Hunger Was A Good Discipline", which appears on page 75 in A MOVEABLE FEAST, as his ". . . new theory that you could omit anthing if you knew you omitted and the omitted part would strengthen the story and make people feel something more than they understood. . . .

I''d probably give this book 3.5 stars, somewhere between it was good and it was OK, if I could.The first of the three sections of this novel is truly good.  It introduces us to Thomas Hudson, a painter and a thinly veiled Hemingway, and his life on the island of Bimini.  Hudson, like Hemingway, is an artist who is serious about his craft and about his work ethic.  We learn of his life among the characters of the island, including the locals and his friends.  The richest part of all is the visit of his three sons (by his first two wives) and the good times they share.  There is good character development of all three boys, each so different from the others and each showing different parts of their father''s personality.  And there are the friends and servants of Hudson''s, whom he loves and who play important parts in his son''s lives, often where it is difficult for a father to enter.  There is a tense shark attack and an epic battle with a monster marlin by the middle son, and there is a great deal of psychology of boys and men woven richly throughout.  Hudson is a father who can''t seem to love all-out, whole-heartedly, even though his sons need and want it.  The feelings are there but the wiring in Hudson''s head and heart shorts out a little and never conducts his deepest, truest self to his boys.  Tragically, Hudson learns of the death of his two youngest sons and their mother (his second wife) at the close of the story.The middle section of the book certainly has some good description and some realistic conversation, but overall it is one running conversation after another, mostly in the context of a bar where Hudson and his companions (who come and go) are drinking heavily, about very little of any importance.  Hudson has just gotten wind of his first son''s death (a pilot in WWII) and ultimately this accounts for the drinking but probably also for the attempts by Hudson to avoid any topic of significance in his conversations with others.  Hudson''s first wife and the only woman he ever deeply loved shows up and they have a rendezvous before Hudson can work up the fortitude to tell her of their son''s death.  They grieve and love together and she has to leave.  All in all, a draggy and hopeless section of this story that doesn''t live up to the first and last sections.The last section follows Hudson and his crew as they conduct anti-submarine activities from his small ship (or large boat) in and around Cuba.  The story is a game of cat and mouse in which Hudson and his crew is the cat and the surviving crew members from a German U-boat is the mouse.  Hemingway builds tension in the hunt and between Hudson''s crew members well.  There are some really exciting moments and some truly touching interaction between Hudson and his crew, as they must try to overcome their differences and dislikes of each other to band together to find and fight the enemy.  After the middle section this is a welcome change...there is actually stuff happening here, a plot.  But it does pail in comparison to the richness of the opening section of this book.All in all, I was glad I read this but the middle section prevents me from liking this book with anything close to whole-heartedness.  And if you are someone who enjoys happy endings, none of the three sections of this book end that way.  The reader is left thinking that likely, as the sons went, so the father goes.  There is much tragedy and hopelessness in this book, which too is a fair reflection of Hemingway''s own life.');

This is one of my favorite Hemingway books and one of the few published posthumously that lives up to his legacy.The book, broken into three distinct sections, recounts chapters in the life of Thomas Hudson, a somewhat thinly veiled version of Hemingway. That''s not to say that this is a story about Hemingway himself, but its pretty clear there is a lot of Hemingway in Hudson.The first section, considered by many to be the best (and, as a I recall, the focus of the film made of the book), takes place in Bimini, where Hudson is leading a fairly idyllic life. The second is centered in Cuba but has an entirely different tone from that of the first. Whereas the "Bimini" section is almost light-hearted and somewhat breezy, the tone of the Cuba section has changed dramatically. Hudson is now a depressed individual having lost a son in an accident. He has a reunion with his first wife, but even though she is the love of his life, he knows it won''t end happily. The third part, "At Sea," recounts Hudson''s efforts as a Nazi sub hunter.Hemingway is at his best throughout much of the book, his men are all striving to prove that they are, well, men, or at least the ideal of what a man should be in Hemingway''s eyes. And naturally enough, no Hemingway man, in this case Hudson, would be complete without a little tragedy in his life. "At Sea," while powerfully told, seems somehow incomplete, which may well be the case since I do not think Hemingway completed the book before his death. In fact, the ending seemed extremely abrupt and left me wondering, did Hudson survive his wounds?Still, this is some of Hemingway''s best work. A must read. The only reason I did not give it five stars is because of the abrupt ending and a few other brief passages in the book that seem somehow incomplete and unfinished.');

They''re American, of course, and to Hemingway the best way to be American is to spend as much time as possible in Europe.  As the title implies, the setting of David and Catherine''s romantic idyll is nothing short of paradise, a splendor of leisure, food, and drink -- and there is indeed a lot of drinking.One day Catherine returns to the hotel where she and David are staying with her hair cut short as a boy''s; this simple but suggestive act precipitates a flurry of homoerotic innuendoes that pervade the remainder of the novel.  At Cannes they meet a beautiful European girl named Marita who is attracted -- sexually -- to both of them, as they are to her.  She becomes their traveling companion and, with everybody''s consent, makes love to Catherine and then to David, but not, I''m afraid, at the same time.  If this menage a trois is supposed to represent the Fall, with Marita playing the role of the Serpent, it seems that Paradise is not yet lost.As a writer, David (like his creator) lets his life become his work, and he is currently inspired to write a story about elephant hunting with his father in Africa, a reminiscence of a transformative boyhood event.  Catherine, an idle and apparently rich girl with no professional aspirations of her own except to char herself to a crisp getting the darkest tan she can, is jealous of his work and the authorial attention he gets; Marita, also rich (Catherine frequently calls her Heiress), is more sympathetic to David''s intense artistic nature.  He is clearly too narcissistic to be in love with anybody but himself and his own work, and being married to him means having to accept that, which may be too much of a sacrifice for Catherine to make.Hemingway''s trademark is that he makes his characters so complex precisely by having them say so little.  The dialogue here is laconic and breezy, as though verbosity would be tedious in a place of such beauty and with people so blithe and lax.  The easy, free flow of the narrative, giving the impression of having been written on autopilot, belies the fact that Hemingway spent the last fifteen years of his life working on this novel sporadically, evidently putting a tremendous amount of consideration into the statement he wanted to make.  Like most of his statements, it bears his unmistakable stamp of restlessness and of impatience with the normal course of the world.');

I discovered this after reading the book in one of his biographical accounts.  It seems that he wrote this one to process out his inner feelings about the actual relationship he lived through.  I wonder how he felt in retrospect?  At times his main character David seems bitter about the whole thing.  At other times he is definitely caught up in it.  He is written much like a puppet, controlled by his wife and the circumstances he runs into.Catherine is one of the more complex female characters that Hemingway ever portrayed.  She reminds me of a more fleshed out Brett, from The Sun Also Rises.  Catherine has a very nihilistic view of life.  She seems driven to do everything in her power to destroy herself and all who cross her path.  She wants pleasure.  She wants to feel good about herself, but just can''t seem to find a way to acheive it.  Poor Catherine...  I couldn''t help but feel for her the whole way through the book.

It was first published in 1995, and considerable work has been done in genetic algorithms since then, but it could still serve as an adequate introduction.  Emphasizing the scientific and machine learning applications of genetic algorithms instead of applications to optimization and engineering, the book could serve well in an actual course on adaptive algorithms. The author includes excellent problem sets at the end of each chapter, these being divided up into "thought exercises" and "computer exercises", and in the latter she includes some challenge problems for the ambitious reader. Chapter 1 is an overview of the main properties of genetic algorithms, along with a brief discussion of their history. The role of fitness landscapes and fitness functions is clearly outlined, and the author defines genetic algorithms as methods for searching fitness landscapes for highly fit strings. An elementary example of a genetic algorithm is given, and the author compares genetic algorithms with more traditional search methods. The author emphasizes the unique features of genetic algorithms that distinguish them from other search algorithms, namely the roles of parallel population-based search with stochastic selection of individuals, and crossover and mutation. A list of applications is given, and two explicit examples of applications are given that deal with the Prisoner''s Dilemna and sorting networks. The author also gives a brief discussion as to how genetic algorithms work from a more mathematical standpoint, emphasizing the role of Holland schemas. The reader more prepared in mathematics can consult the references for more in-depth discussion. The next chapter stresses the role of genetic algorithms in problem solving, beginning with a discussion of genetic programming. Automatic programming has long been a goal of computer scientists, and the author discusses the role of genetic programming in this area, particularly the work of John Koza on evolving LISP programs. In addition, she discusses the current work on evolving cellular automata and its role in automatic programming. The latter discussion is more detailed, this resulting from the author''s personal involvement in artificial life research. Those interested in time series prediction tools will appreciate the discussion on the use of genetic algorithms to predict the behavior of dynamical systems, with an example given on predicting the behavior of the (chaotic) Mackey-Glass dynamical system. The author also gives applications of genetic algorithms in predicting protein structure, an area of application that has exploded in recent years, due to the importance of the proteome projects. The area of neural networks has also been influenced by genetic algorithms, and the author discusses how they have replaced the familiar back-propagation algorithm as a method to find the optimal weights. Chapter 3 is more in line with what the author intended in the book, namely a discussion of the relevance of genetic algorithms to study the mechanisms behind natural selection. She discusses the "Baldwin effect", which gives a connection between what an organism has learned (a small time-scale process) to the evolutionary history of the Earth (a long time-scale process). A simple model of the Baldwin effect is given using a genetic algorithm, along with a discussion of the Ackley-Littman evolutionary reinforcement learning model, which involves the use of neural networks, and which is another computational demonstration of the Baldwin effect. In addition, the author discusses models for sexual selection and ecosystems based on genetic algorithms. These are the "artificial life" models that the author has been involved in, and she gives a very understandable overview of their properties. Chapter 4 should suit the curiosity of the mathematician or computer scientist who wants to understand the theoretical justification behind the use of genetic algorithms. Again employing the Holland notion of schemas and adaptation as a "tension between exploration and exploitation", the author formulates a mathematical model, called the Two-Armed Bandit Problem, of how genetic algorithms are used to study the tradeoffs in this tension. The level of mathematics used here is very elementary with the emphasis placed on the intuition behind this model, with only a sketch of the model''s solution given. To address the role of crossover in genetic algorithms, the author discusses in detail a class of fitness landscapes, called "Royal Road functions" that she and others have developed. The performance of the genetic algorithm employed is then compared against the three different hill-climbing methods. Formal mathematical models of genetic algorithms are also discussed, one of which involves dynamical systems, another using Markov chains,  and one using the tools of statistical mechanics. The latter is very interesting from a physics standpoint but is only briefly sketched. The interested physicist reader can consult the references given by the author for further details. Practical use of genetic algorithms demands an understanding of how to implement them, and the author does so in the last chapter of the book. She outlines some ideas on just when genetic algorithms should be used, and this is useful since a newcomer to the field may be tempted to view a genetic algorithm as merely a fancy Monte Carlo simulation. The most difficult part of using a genetic algorithm is how to encode the population, and the author discusses various ways to do this. She also details various "exotic" approaches to improving the performance of genetic algorithms, such as the "messy" genetic algorithms. One must also choose a selection method when employing genetic algorithms, and the author shows how to do this using various techniques, such as roulette wheel and stochastic universal sampling. In addition, genetic operators must also be chosen in implementing genetic algorithms, and the author emphasizes crossover and mutation for this purpose. Lastly, the values of the parameters of the genetic algorithm, such as population size, crossover rate, and mutation rate must be chosen. The author discusses various approaches to this. Although brief, she does give a large set of references for further reading.');

The imperial ambitions of Italy''s dictator, Benito Mussolini, bring the Italian army of occupation.  Among the troops is Captain Antonio Corelli, artillery officer and musician.  An unwitting and hesitant imperial minion, he is billeted in the Iannis household.  Although the doctor urges passive resistance, Pelagia, although committed to a partisan youth, is drawn to Corelli''s musical talents and unworldly charm.

There are continual surprises as events twist and bend the characters.  Some break, others find a means to extricate themselves from a tangling fate.  Pelagia bears the main burden throughout.  Her love for Corelli, after a fitful start, blossoms, then is tested by the swirl of events.  Other characters come into her life, remain or depart.

Such a masterful mix of comedy and tragedy is rare, indeed. In parts I couldn''t stop laughing, much to my sleeping husband''s annoyance as I read it late into  the night.

De Berniers''s obvious love of  his characters, his painstaking research, his use of challenging vocabulary  that often sent me gleefully into the dictionary, his masterful unfolding  of plot -- all combined to keep me in continual awe of his writing. And  now, about THAT ending: Yes, there was a definite shift from the intricate  details of most of the book, which covered a relatively short period of  time. But to cover decades in that same detailed style would be utterly  impossible! (Unless it becomes a multi-volume epic, which I believe in this  case would be unsustainable.) I was impressed, actually, that De Berniers  was able to give enough details to make the unfolding of those decades not  too rushed. It was like travelling on a speeding train through the  landscape, but stopping long enough in some places to get one''s bearings,  get a decent feel for the time and place, and even go into some shops and  have a nice meal and a chat with the locals. I LIKED the way De Berniers  constructed the "bridge", then, from the war to the present, to  what we can see and experience on the island of Cephalonia today. As far as  the culmination of the love-story is concerned, without giving away the  ending, I found it satisfying and realistic. The characters remained  essentially consistent, although circumstances and their lives had  drastically changed.

This short tale is of a family totally controlled and dominated by a father''s greed. The father actually weighs out eggs, butter, flour, and sugar for the family servant to use every day. His wife, daughter, and family servant all have adjusted their views of reality to accomodate his greed. The equilibrium is upset when Cousin Charles Grandet comes to visit. The women in the household cater to the needs of this handsome young man but the father is unsympathetic upon hearing that his brother has become bankrupt and a suicide and the young man is penniless. By the time the young man leaves, the daughter of the house is totally in love with him. She writes to Charles but after a few letters he fails to respond further to her letters. As the miserly father withers and dies, so too does the expectations and soul of his daughter, Eugenie. Balzac did a really fine job of showing how self defeating the miser''s greed was to his family and his relationship with his wife and child. After the death of the father, Eugenie inherits a fortune. Cousin Charles meanwhile has become rich through the slave trade between African and the Caribbean. His soul has shrunk and he is about to marry a 19 year old socialite for her family connections. He writes a letter telling Eugenie that he has never stopped loving her but that he must look out for his interests with this advantageous marriage. He receives a letter back that is polite yet biting, gracious yet revengeful, compassionate and understanding yet reminding of the lost opportunity. Charles then finds out that his cousin, whom he loves, is extremely wealthy and he has made a decision that he thought was advantageous which turned out to be less than optimal. Balzac has the faithful maid as the only winner in the story.  Eugenie rewards her for her years of hard work and service. The story resonates with Henry James'' Washington Square. They both involve a triangle between a rich father, an innocent daughter, and a suitor. The difference is that James'' father is cruel to his daughter thinking that since she is plain and shy that men will court her only for money. Eugenie''s father''s obsession was wealth, the effects on his family were a consequence of his greed, not due to his conscious demeaning sarcasm. Both heroines seek revenge on the suitor, James'' with a trick and Balzac''s with a superbly written letter that left the revenge to his own immagination and judgement. James'' suitor was indeed a crook, whereas Charles Grandet was lead into opportunism and missed chances. Finally, the Aunt in Washington Square was a silly gossip who was not supportive of the daughter/niece whereas the mother and servant in Eugenie Grandet were supportive of Eugenie. I would strongly recommend reading Eugenie Grandet, a concise,short, book. Balzac was just to his characters and this realistic justice made for a fine short novel.');

At the age of 20 years he already published more than a hundred books all describing very human characters, portrayed in a prose with an unseen force. Because the same characters appeared often in more than one book, Balzac created a universe of his own, which he himself called "La Comédie Humaine".In Eugénie Grandet, a novel dating from 1833, one gets acquainted with father Grandet, an extremely wealthy and greedy aristocrat living together with his wife and daughter in Saumur, France.  His daughter Eugénie has grown to maturity and her father has no other goal than to see her getting married. But who is suitable enough for his precious daughter? Surely not her adopted nephew Charles Grandet, not? Eugénie has to fight against the tyrannical power of her father, but gets help from their faithful servent, Nanon.Through this tragedy Balzac reveals one of the most destructive vices of man: greed. Although the author does not recoil from an ever-growing list of moralizing statements, the story stays authentic enough to pull the reader into the story. The comparison with a masterpiece as Wuthering Heights is easily made and not only because it dates from the same period. But to make from Eugénie Grandet a true classic it certainly misses depth.');

In the town of Saumur, M. Grandet is a wine merchant, a miser in full. This is a despicable man, but like good characters in literature, he has an understandable, if unjustifiable, reason for his behavior. He wants to give his family a perennial financial security. The problem is, that is all he wants for his family. Nothing else matters. So the family leads a monastical life, luxury is forbidden, joy is expensive. Eugenie is a likable but shy young lady, without any knowledge of the world whatsoever. Balzac is just great at creating the environment and mood. You can see the big, old house, the leaves fallen from the trees and rustling in the silent evenings of this town. You can feel the boredom of lifeless life, the long, long afternoons. The avaricious man lecturing everybody for spending like crazy, anguished at every penny spent, regardless of what was bought or consumed.So, two families are looking forward to having one of their sons married to Eugenie, but Daddy is looking for more wealth, and refuses to share his with these provincial people. Then his brother committs suicide in account of financial trouble, and Grandet''s nephew, Charles, comes to town. He and Eugenie fall in love, but there is no chance M. Grandet will accept a marriage with the son of a ruined man. Charles, thus, leaves for the Indies to look for fortune. Someday he''ll come back, but things will never be the same. As the years pass, we see Eugenie go on with her dull life, her heart saddened and cold.Balzac''s novel paints an accurate and believable portrait of French society at the time, but it would not have survived if that had been all. As the title of this review states, this work has transcended because it is literature of the higher sort, that which goes directly to the human heart and mind, to situations that do not pass with age, but remain embedded in any society.

Well, having just had the experience (and it is an experience) of reading John Cleland''s 1748-9 novel, "Memoirs of a Woman of Pleasure," everything else just seems like children''s literature. Cleland''s "Memoirs" was simultaneously reviled and a best seller, declared obscene and yet continued to be published illegally througout the 18th century. In the aftermath of the public frenzy for and against Samuel Richardson''s ultra-famous novels "Pamela" and "Clarissa" and Henry Fielding''s equally famous responses, "Shamela," "Joseph Andrews," and "Tom Jones," Cleland''s novel strikes out into wholly uncharted moral and aesthetic territory.Similarly to Defoe''s "Moll Flanders," Cleland''s novel begins with its heroine, Fanny Hill, an innocent, uneducated country girl, thrown at a very early age into the cruel world of London and forced into a life of prostitution. As an innocent virgin, the madam whose house she live in is saving Fanny for a noble customer whom they expect daily, but learns about sexual commerce by watching other prostitutes in the house. Eloping with a beautiful, wealthy young man named Charles before she engages in any sexual activity, the novel concerns Fanny''s sexual awakenings and her life with and without her first love, Charles. The way that the novel refigures fidelity in the relationship between Fanny and Charles is astounding.Cleland''s master-stroke, if you will, linguistically, is to write a whole-heartedly pornographic novel and couch everything in such a rich variety of metaphors. Graphic scenarios can be found on almost every page, but there is a marked and remarkable absence of graphic language. Structurally, Cleland''s plotting of Fanny Hill''s escapades is exquisitely balanced and even-handed. Morally and aesthetically, "Memoirs" comes straight out of the strain of 18th century moral philosophy associated by turns, with Shaftesbury and David Hume. From Shaftesbury, Cleland takes the idea that aesthetics and morality should be judged on an equal form in works of art. From Hume, he takes the radical stance that vices and luxuries are not inherently evil, and even acceptable when not carried to extremes. Cleland makes judicious use of these structural and philosophical elements in creating one of the strongest and most liberated heroines in English literature.Among other points of interest in the novel, there is the prevalence and even propriety of expressions of feminine desire, agency, power, and control over self and circumstances. Aside from her first entrance into London and her various periods as a kept-mistress, Fanny Hill is educated by the prostitute Phoebe, and the procuress Mrs. Cole to be an independent, self-regulating subject. Related to this is the rather revolutionary notion inferred that sexual education predicates all other sources of knowledge, and is at heart, the basis and foundation of human interaction, at least in the semi-utopic world of the novel.There are so many fascinating things about Cleland''s "Memoirs of a Woman of Pleasure," it would take forever to puzzle through them all. All the same, I''ve only been able myself to think critically about the novel at some distance of remove from reading it. Reading this novel was an interesting, but frustrating, and at times impossible task. It''s not a difficult novel to read in terms of prose, but for a 188 page novel, it tends to overwhelm everything else while you''re reading it. Like I said, reading "Memoirs" is an experience - I often had to look at the cover to recall that this is no simple work of pornography, but an acknowledged work of classic literature. By all accounts, a captivating novel. It gets five stars just because it is so amazing and outlandish. Aside from the Marquis de Sade, who belongs properly to the excesses of the Romantic Era, I had no idea that there was anything even remotely like this in the 18th century.  To quote that immortal philospher, Stephon Marbury, Cleland''s novel is "all nude...but tastefully done."');

Unlike most porn, she''s not always happy about her sexual encounters, and there are times when she''s heartbroken over a lost love.  She''s decieved by a woman who claims to be hiring her "as a companion," in a another scene she''s exploited by a money-hungry landlord.As she grows older, though, Fanny becomes more in charge of her sexuality and more open to exploration.  We, as readers, also see a glimpse of 18th-century prostitution and the demimonde of kept mistresses (which many wealthy men of the period kept).Hardly a rollicking farce (there are times when sex has serious consequences) but at times it is humorous.  Never crass or vulgar, but nevertheless explicit, this bawdy gem is worth checking out.  Fanny is always honest about herself and what she does to survive, and pulls no punches.

I was expecting a story that made much of a few kisses behind the pantry door or a bared ankle or two, but I was certainly wrong about that.Cleland manages to write a steamy story without ever being crass or resorting to using filthy language to get a reaction.  It''s hard to belive that it was published in 1749. Everything about the people in the novel seems so modern and no one ever thinks that the people of Cleland''s time even had thoughts or lives like he describes.Yet this novel has it''s problems too.The plot is an old one, young innocent country girl goes to the big city to seek her fortune and falls in the hands of some disreputable people.  It''s a story that''s as old as the profession the book is about.  At one point in the novel I wondered if maybe the people who wrote the script for Pretty Woman had been reading Fanny Hill for plot ideas.Cleland starts a very nice love story for our heroine, but then it fades out for most of the novel and returns without warning or explanation at the end.  In fact, the end of the novel seemed rushed in this readers opinion, and rendered the whole story a bit silly.  Not to mention a couple of holes in the plot that are big enough to drive a Mack truck through.Overall, it''s a good book, and should be read if for no other reason than to see for yourself just how erotic it really is.

The diamond carried a curse which brought trouble to whom ever possessed it.In brief "The Moonstone" is a suspenseful story of the gifting of the diamond to a young lady on her 18th birthday in 1848, its disappearance the same night and the subsequent search for it until 1850.The way the mystery is told is most interesting. Eleven different characters relating their role as well as to what they could personally attest to the robbery. This provides various views on what occurred and how the actions of others were interpreted.In these narratives the reader learns of the history of the diamond and it''s three Indian protectors, the gifting, the loss and the search for the diamond from a long-time servant in the country home of the wealthy family, the poor Christian spinster cousin who thrives on doing good work and spreading the faith. Two male cousins one a gambler and the other somewhat of a dilettante, both wishing to marry the same cousin. The wealthy side of the family, the family solicitor, the village doctor and his assistant, a police sargent who specializes in family thefts and roses, and a well traveled man with certainty some Indian heritage. It provides an interesting cross-section of life in Victorian England.It is one of the earliest mystery novels written, and was serialized, likely in a newspaper, when first published.

In the case of The Sun Also Rises, the style is obviously a significant departure from the Victorian sludge that demanded lengthy artistic passages depicting settings and motivations.  In this book, Jake''s sexual impotence due to a wartime aircraft accident is not only understated but dealt by ellipses.  But also with Hemingway, the impact of frustrated passion by Lady Brett and Jake is defined by sexual frustration, not love.  A real love would have found ways for them to live together and get around the problem. I find Hemingway''s approach is more typical of his macho testosterone obsession with  everything. While sexual attraction and fulfillment (and some will say procreation)  is the essence of relations between a man and a woman, wiser heads know that real love is found in the deeper relationships between personalities as well as the flesh.Moreover, I think the so-called "lost generation" thing is overdone, as is the bullfight nonsense.  Because a few artists, writers and wannabes gathered at the pumps on the Left Bank does not make them typical of a generation - what was typical in my opinion was the revulsion from the war and its affect on  Western civilization.  Most people got on with the job of having kids - establishing families - out of the personal wreckage of the war. In short, I felt the story was overblown as a universal of the times.Finally, a note about the Kindle version which I downloaded. All of Hemingway''s novels which I have recently read in Kindle suffer from word breaks and elisions and mis-scanned letters. Of course at the price one can hardly complain or expect word-by-word.editing.But all-told,an interesting and useful refresher to the world of Hemingway - but there are story lines that I like much better: as examples: "For Whom The Bell Tolls" and "A Farewell to Arms".  I thought "The Old Man and the Sea", a novelette on which the Nobel was hung, not as momentous as it was made out to be.');

On this 1933-34 African safari, his jovial, Socratic drinking pal "Pop" is actually Phillip Percival the famous white hunter  who conducted Theodore Roosevelt on his first African safari.  As a young  man, Hemingway owned a copy of TR''s book "African Game Trails,"  and it is undoubtedly one of the reasons he went on this safari, which was  financed to the tune of $25,000 Depression dollars by his wife Pauline''s  uncle Gus, part owner of Richard Hudnut cosmetics.  Further evidence of  Hem''s fascination with Africa can be seen in the way Jake Barnes teases  Robert Cohn in "The Sun Also Rises."  In chapter two, Jake says,  " Did you ever think about going to British East Africa to  shoot?"  Cohn''s lack of enthusiasm for an immediate trek to Mombassa  seals his fate as a jerk.  "Green Hills" vindicates Hem''s real  aficion for hunting--filled with long descriptions of the arduous and  sometimes futile tracking of game, not just celebratory "kills."  Finally, the best preparation for reading "The Short Happy Life of  Francis Macomber" and "The Snows of Kilimanjaro" is to hike  and sweat through these 300 pages of African "country."  The  long, crescent-horned sable which Hem was painstakingly stalking at the end  of "Green Hills" never turned up.  But instead, the experience of  his African safari, was distilled into those two incredible stories--one  about a coward who gets a chance to redeem himself and the other about a  washed-up writer whose approaching death stimulates him to dream about--and  the reader to enjoy--the fiction he never got to actually write.  Unless  you''ve got a rich uncle or wife, this is as close as you''ll get to an East  African safari, and it is very, very fine.');

It went a  long way in establishing Hemingway''s reputation as a hunter and adventurer.  Though non-fiction it has the organization of a Hemingway novel and reads  much like his other works.  His descriptions of the landscape, local  people, other hunters, and especially animals, hunting, and killing are  superb.  Hemingway also shares, mostly as dialogue, his thoughts on life,  war, fate, and notably literature and the literary life.  His often-quoted  idea of all American literature being descended from one book by Mark Twain  is presented here, as are his thoughts on how America destroys its writers.  Some knowledge of Eastern Africa (such as a basic history, a guidebook, an  encyclopedia article) might be useful as Hemingway often does provide much  introductory material.  With "Green Hills of Africa" Hemingway  follows in the footsteps of Theodore Roosevelt''s "African Game  Trails"; both did much to popularize among Americans the idea of  recreational travel in Africa.  Hemingway went on to write two fictional  stories set in Africa: "The Snows of Kilimanjaro" and "The  Short Happy Life of Francis Macomber".  A good book, moreso for fans  of Papa and those with an interest in Africa.');

On one level it''s a recounting of a big-game safari that Hemingway undertook with one of his many wives (referred to only by initials, POM) and two of their friends - Karl, whom he finds himself rivalling in a bid to bag the best game; Mr JP or Pop, in real life an acclaimed hunter/guide who apparently accompanied Roosevelt on a safari.The details can be a bit confusing as the four of them move, sometimes together and sometimes separately, across a lot of African country that is differentiated only by the quality of its game and a lot of long African names that are impossible to keep track of.  Otherwise it''s easygoing - this is Hemingway''s simple direct prose at its best, and probably the most readable of his books that I''ve come across so far.  There is a simplicity and contentment in his writing that evokes very well the lifestyle they led, untroubled by anything except the desire to shoot the perfect kudu; each day spent in a beautiful country eating, reading, walking and hunting, then going to sleep and waking to do the exact same things; where all triumphs and tragedies are to do with hunting and no world beyond that exists.  For once Hemingway even has a happyending!  It''s certainly an eye-opener for the majority of us who, not being rich white expatriates in a time when environmentalism and animal rights hardly merited concern, will never embark on a safari.  The fact that it''s wholly non-fiction is a trifle surprising, for events build up to a convenient climax, and the ending contains convenient closure.Delve a little deeper and Hemingway allows us to accompany him through his thoughts - his reflections on Africa, hunting, writing, living.  He has a knack for looking at things in an unique light, reducing concepts down to simple terms and insisting that this is the way things are... Also, an idea of the author himself - the type of person he is - is built up quite clearly, more so than in ''A Moveable Feast''.

At the start of the 20th century, he and a group of similarly hopeful Lithuanians made their pilgrimage to the beating heart of capitalism, only to find the heel of its boot.  After navigating their way to Chicago’s meat packing district, the families endure extreme hardship and the brutal underside rather than uplifting promise of capitalism.The Jungle draws comparison to other tales of hardship – for example Faulkner’s The Grapes of Wrath – but Sinclair offers a twist.  Rather than a study of characters caught up in an epic event such as the Depression-era Dust Bowl, Sinclair uses his characters’ hardship to critique the setting itself.  More specifically, the characters are a vehicle to highlight the uneven and immoral impacts of capitalism, and to deliver a lesson in left-leaning (socialist?) economics and politics.Sinclair advances his theme in four stages.  First, in the largest section, he chronicles the dehumanizing work in Chicago’s meat packing district and the revolting methods the plant owners use to pass off inedible meat to unwitting consumers.  If it’s not enough to make readers question the balance of power between labor and capital, it will certainly make them rethink what they eat.The second, shorter stage shows Jurgis via a scrape with the law up against the broader industrial/political/media complex.  It’s not so much that the law is stacked against Jurgis; the justice is perfunctory and with the barest standards of due process.  Rather, it is the systemic intertwining political and industrial connections of others accused and acquitted, and of those meting out justice that rankles Sinclair.  “Government existed under the form of a democracy. The officials who ruled it, and got all the graft, had to be elected first; and so there were two rival sets of grafters, known as political parties, and the one got the office which bought the most votes.”The third stage - an interlude, really - follows Jurgis as a hobo after turning his back on Chicago, capitalism, and the social contract.  He lives by his wits when a chance encounter permits him inside a meat packing industrialist’s mansion.  The unneeded, undeserved and unproductive wealth stands in stark contrast to laborers’ deprivation and drives home Sinclair’s message about unfettered capitalism.  Jurgis’ life as a hobo, outside the capital/labor struggle, harkens back to an idyllic (Edenic, not Hobbesian) time before capitalism, and foreshadows the possibility of another path … but not before Jurgis takes a turn working within the power structure, which proves less punishing than as a laborer but equally unfruitful.The fourth stage reconciles the plot elements of the first three stages and presents a socialist alternative.  “In America everyone had laughed at the mere idea of Socialism then — in America all men were free.  As if political liberty made wage slavery any the more tolerable!”  The Hobbesian bargain had metastasized under the natural power imbalances of capitalism, just as Marx had warned a few decades earlier, and the promise of socialism offered Jurgis a third path.  He need not choose between the perpetually antagonistic labor and capital, but rather from a third option, in which one could select a job and receive remuneration based upon his or her contribution (labor hours and skill), all of which would advance broader societal goals.  Government (rather than the oppressive capitalists) would establish the value of labor contributions.  Sinclair envisioned a workers’ movement which would gently rule, and progress would be guided by ‘an invisible hobo hand’.Written after both Adam Smith’s and Marx’s theorizing but before the Russian Revolution, history has since shown the weakness of Sinclair’s concluding sermon, and even the labor theory of value that Sinclair touts was being supplanted when the book was written.  Still, The Jungle is a seminal and cautionary tale of the power struggle between capital and labor.  It applies equally well to the disposability of labor in today’s era of globalization and automation, and perhaps to intellectual capital in the coming era of Artificial Intelligence.Sinclair’s plot is straightforward – simply a vehicle to critique the capitalist system – and offers none of the rollicking twists in Dickens’ working-class novels.  Nor does it feature the robust character development of other authors.  What it does offer is one of the first literary indictments of unfettered capitalism, and for this it should be read by all with an interest in politics and economics.');

Whether it is 100 years of Buenida family history spread over 500 pages, it flows very nicely. It''s a page turner of a book, as you pass from one generation to another in a haze of names that keep repeating.Solitude is a metaphor, for melancholy, seclusion, mental illness, and many more similar feelings. Everybody goes through some dose of solitude through life, and it''s nice to be able to reflect through Marquez''s characters. What is interesting for me though is that most of the characters would be committed into instructions or jailed in our modern societies. However, with all their idiosyncrasies, obsessive-compulsiveness, and plain madness, they all managed to go through their existences long before the advent of mind-numbing medications.Life was sure simpler, and far more entertaining back in this era. I would recommend this book, to anybody who wants to expand their literary horizons, and their understanding of some dark corners of human nature.I can only hope that Marquez is spending the last days of his life at peace with his solitude...');

In today''s time and age, ''love story'' carries a connotation that isn''t really fitting for this book, but I hope ''epic'' captures this.What''s most brilliant about Márquez is how he vividly captures the imagination and leads you into this world, where you feel that you are living the lives of the characters and you learn about them. In this manner, you also learn a lot about your own life and human nature in general, which makes his work powerful.Furthermore, in describing these lives from mundane details to the extraordinary, he weaves in a subtle social commentary regarding such diverse topics as gender relations, race, class, politics. The thing that strikes me the most about this is that he does this all without becoming ''preachy'' but in the subtlest fashion.It leaves you with a sense of the power of love, a love that is currently not in fashion, but also with the sense that the Caribbean and Latin American in general is constantly ravaged by war, disease, and corruption that continues unabated for almost a century.');

Lewis''s classic novel, the sequel to his even more classic "The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe." While it has some drippily allegorical moments near the end, Lewis does a pretty good job with what must have been a difficult sequel.When his aunt gives birth to a baby boy, young Prince Caspian finds himself on the run from his usurping uncle Miraz -- and in the hands of Narnia''s secret army of dwarves, centaurs, talking animals and nature spirits. Soon Caspian has an army backing his claim to the throne, but in a moment of desperation, he is forced to blow the magic horn of the legendary Queen Susan -- and subsequently pulls the Pevensies back into Narnia.But while only a year has passed on Earth, centuries have passed in Narnia, and the kids find that it''s no longer the place they left -- they and Aslan are distant memories, and their castle lies in ruins. And as they are led by a very skeptical dwarf to help Caspian, Lucy keeps glimpsing Aslan along the way -- a sign that things are about to change drastically in Narnia, both for the human and magical inhabitants...The Chronicles of Narnia were probably the first books to feature what is now standard in the fantasy genre -- an ordinary person gets dragged into another world. Just take a look at successful, unique authors like Diana Wynne Jones and Garth Nix to get an example of how Lewis'' stories have influenced the entire genre.If you don''t like allegory (religious or otherwise), then steer clear of "Prince Caspian," especially the second half. While Lewis''s beliefs are presented in a more complicated and subtle manner in his other fictional works, here the parallels to basic Christian beliefs are very obvious. Reportedly even Tolkien, one of Lewis''s best pals, found the allegory annoying.But if you can get past the slightly ham-handed treatment, it''s a lovely little read. Lewis interweaves mythical elements -- dwarves, nymphs, talking animals, witches -- with the chatty, slightly precious style of traditional British storytelling. But this one is a bit darker and more action-packed than "The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe," with some unexpected twists in the middle of it all. The scene with a strange witch and a werewolf is downright chilling, in fact.But Lewis'' plotting does sag near the end, during a drippy scene where Aslan wanders around fixing life for Narnian subjects. Fortunately after that, he gets back to a mystery that hangs over the whole book -- just where did all these humans come from, if they were such a rarity in the previous adventure?Peter seems a bit more jaded than before and Edmund a bit more mature, but sadly the girls don''t get enough to do this time around. But Caspian is a likable and believable prepubescent king-in-waiting, and surrounded by a bunch of unique Narnians -- a gentle yet fierce badger, a hostile dwarf, a fiery mouse, and the delightfully skeptical Trumpkin, who doesn''t believe in lions.Despite a few rough spots, "Prince Caspian" is a slightly darker, more intricate story, and its finale marks a turning point in the Chronicles of Narnia. Definitely give it a read before you see the movie.');

Hardy sees these as being transient and subject to great change even within a society. The novel is replete with references to differences in religious creed and how these foster intolerance - between high and low Anglicanism and with both to Roman Catholicism. The novel shows great  families falling into obscurity and other families assuming great histories to which they are not entitled. The conventions that enable these are not eternal. They are not inevitable. They have a beginning and they have an end. And yet, as Hardy shows, they claim the power to regulate the lives of human beings even to the point of condemnation.

It is these social conventions  that Hardy identifies as transient and not eternal. he doubts their legitimacy. That is the main theme of the novel.');

For Pelagia Iannis the cost of transition is heavy.  Daughter of the village''s widower doctor, she is caught up in global forces beyond her ken.  The imperial ambitions of Italy''s dictator, Benito Mussolini, bring the Italian army of occupation.  Among the troops is Captain Antonio Corelli, artillery officer and musician.  An unwitting and hesitant imperial minion, he is billeted in the Iannis household.  Although the doctor urges passive resistance, Pelagia, although committed to a partisan youth, is drawn to Corelli''s musical talents and unworldly charm.  De Bernieres weaves an intricate tale of love, war, humour and pathos with unrivaled skill.  His characters sparkle with realism, an aspect permeating this outstanding work.  His descriptions of the interactions of the differing nationalities and ideologies ring vividly true.As he builds the story through the characters and events, de Bernieres gives little away.  There are continual surprises as events twist and bend the characters.  Some break, others find a means to extricate themselves from a tangling fate.  Pelagia bears the main burden throughout.  Her love for Corelli, after a fitful start, blossoms, then is tested by the swirl of events.  Other characters come into her life, remain or depart.  All make some impact as de Bernieres adroitly builds her role.  Each chapter becomes a minor tale in its own right, with all tied together flawlessly.  Characters and events are imparted with meticulous detail, yet, like a Mozart opera, not one word would bear excision.If you like a story that successfully ranges over a variety of issues and people, you will seek far and wide to surpass this tale.  De Bernieres'' skills in portraying life''s complexities, yet maintaining reader attention and interest are peerless.  He has clearly build his work on thorough scholarship - there''s even a source list at the end.  His sweeping view will leave you exhilarated and breathless, but fulfilled.

Such a masterful mix of comedy and tragedy is rare, indeed. In parts I couldn''t stop laughing, much to my sleeping husband''s annoyance as I read it late into  the night. Then unstoppable tears would flow. De Berniers''s obvious love of  his characters, his painstaking research, his use of challenging vocabulary  that often sent me gleefully into the dictionary, his masterful unfolding  of plot -- all combined to keep me in continual awe of his writing. And  now, about THAT ending: Yes, there was a definite shift from the intricate  details of most of the book, which covered a relatively short period of  time. But to cover decades in that same detailed style would be utterly  impossible! (Unless it becomes a multi-volume epic, which I believe in this  case would be unsustainable.) I was impressed, actually, that De Berniers  was able to give enough details to make the unfolding of those decades not  too rushed. It was like travelling on a speeding train through the  landscape, but stopping long enough in some places to get one''s bearings,  get a decent feel for the time and place, and even go into some shops and  have a nice meal and a chat with the locals. I LIKED the way De Berniers  constructed the "bridge", then, from the war to the present, to  what we can see and experience on the island of Cephalonia today. As far as  the culmination of the love-story is concerned, without giving away the  ending, I found it satisfying and realistic. The characters remained  essentially consistent, although circumstances and their lives had  drastically changed. The criteria for a good ending, as far as I''m  concerned, is that I feel satisfied, that it feels "right", and  that I couldn''t completely predict it, although some hints were pointing me  in that general direction. It met those criteria for me.');

Will they find their answers, and escape Aenir alive?The idea of dreamworlds and living shadows would seem stupid in most fantasy series. But Garth Nix actually manages to carry it off -- "Aenir" can be somewhat confusing, but once readers get everything straight, its remarkable imagination begins to shine through.Not a lot of time is spent in Tal''s lightless, icy world in this book; it mostly takes place in Aenir. Nix manages to create a sort of lucid dream, where things make logical sense, but they can be nightmarish and bizarre. He also gives the story a tragic twist for Tal, and deepens the mystery of the malevolent Sushin, who has been making trouble for Tal ever since the first book.There''s not a lot of character development in this book, since Tal and Milla''s personalities were formed over the past two novels. Most of this book is action. But Nix does introduce two likable characters -- Odris and Adras, a pair of Storm Shepherds who provide guidance and comic relief for our heroes.Things get stranger and tenser in the third volume of the Seventh Tower series, and only promise to get better after "Aenir."

Things get darker and tenser, and the mystery becomes even more twisted.Tal''s family is being mysteriously victimized, and will become outcasts unless he can get into the mystical land of Aenir. But now he''s captive of the Icecarls, and is the grudging ally of the tough wannabe-shieldmaiden Milla. After meeting with the ancient Mother Crone, Tal agrees to help sneak Milla in, so they can both find Sunstones -- he for his family, she for her people.But they have more trouble. After getting inside and consulting with Uncle Ebbitt, he tells them that they must find the Codex in Aenir. Then things take a hideous turn: The two kids are captured. Tal is imprisoned in the Pit -- and discovers something about his father''s fate. And Milla is trapped with the half-shadow-half-man monster Fashnek, in the Hall of Nightmares...Though "Castle" is not as strong as "Fall," it''s a darker, weirder story that adds to the mystery. Why does Sushin hate Tal and his family so much? What is happening to the Sunstones, if they''re dying and becoming useless? And who was the mysterious Longface, a Chosen taken in by the Icecarls -- what was he terrified of?Nix''s talent for fantastical horror is also more evident here, in the hideous Fashnek, who has an insectile shadow-claw over part of his body. While "Fall" was pretty much pure fantasy, "Castle" has the darker, more macabre bits -- probably even more as the series progresses. And his talent for creating familiar but alien cultures now extends to the Icecarls as well as the Chosen.Tal was a well-rounded character to start with, and he doesn''t disappoint in this book. Milla gets a bit more depth, and shows some liking for Tal and Uncle Ebbitt. She softens a little bit, while being no less tough. Uncle Ebbit is likably quirky, but more serious, and the Mother Crone is an intriguing old wisewoman.The second part of the "Seventh Tower" series is a little darker than the first book, and a little more of what fans expect from Nix.

In this book Tal and Milla get back to the castle only to find that Tal''s family is on the wrong side of a political power play.

In this book Nix also starts to address the cultural arrogance that both Tal and Milla have learned from their societies.  I think Nix has a great way of addressing some of the major social concerns of today''s society in an a manner that''s easily digestible for the intended age group for this book.  He does so with an intriguing and well written story.

They were beneficent to the population. The harm they brought was indirect, subtle and inevitable.

It is also important that they go by multiple names Nostromo, Gian Battista, Captain Fidanza, and the Capitaz and Charles Gould as Don Carlos, Charles, Charley and the administrator of the San Tome mine. This is important because these names are not just different labels for the same persons but notifiers for personas that have markedly different social and personal implications. A major theme of this book is that the economic forces created by the new technologies introduced to the region affect the personalities of these characters. These impersonal forces change what they value and how they act. Both Gould and Nostromo become captives of the silver from the mines. They lose things that that are valuable in their lives. The things they value are changed. They do not do this by conscious choice but unconsciously with the impetus of these outside influences.The changes in Costaguna are beneficial and harmful at the same time. They bring peace and prosperity but the old community that existed there is inevitably lost. This is not an adventure novel. It is not a tale of fighting and daring-do. It is a novel in which the plot is moved forward within the description of characters. It is an analysis of the economic forces which shape values and which shapes how people live.

Each of these groups is vividly depicted as working for its own ends and not for the good of the people, and with their goals focused on the real world, these characters have no self-awareness, nor do they develop it during the novel.In contrast to these "unrealized" humans, Conrad presents several characters who develop some self-awareness through their experiences.  Nostromo, a local legend, is a man of principle who has always kept his word.  Martin Decoud, a newspaper man, is a nihilist who has editorialized against the revolution, though he has yet to test himself.  Dr. Monygham, captured during a past revolution, broke under torture, and is now seeking absolution by fighting against this revolution. And the good and long-suffering wife of Charles Gould, Dona Emilia, who has lost her husband to his silver mine, now devotes her life to helping others.When Nostromo agrees to protect a load of silver from revolutionaries by taking it out to sea, he takes Decoud with him, leaving him on an island with the silver when they almost sink.  Decoud''s reaction to his isolation, and Nostromo''s reaction to the treasure that is suddenly "his," provide a dark commentary on idealism and human nature.  In the conclusion, which includes a love story that feels tacked on, Conrad''s darkest self is revealed, offering little hope of change and even less hope for man''s redemption.  Rich in atmosphere, vibrant in description, filled with characters representing all walks of life and philosophy, and set in a country where revolution is a way of life, the novel is full of dark portents and bleak political outcomes.

Alongside the larger group of natives and other people of color or lower class there is a small core group of Europeans, among those the Goulds.  In spite of being third generation South American Charles Gould still goes to England to find a wife.  Later when he decides to develop the silver mine he inherits from his father he goes to the United States to find a rich investor.  The silver mine becomes a huge success, only to become the target of political revolutionaries, and the story really begins when there is an attempted coup and takeover of the silver mine.  Much attention is given to inner conflicts and tough moral choices that individuals are forced to.Detailed descriptions of both characters and settings makes this novel quite a dense reading experience, particularly the first section which contains very little dialogue and reads like a documentary.  Only the final section of the novel seemed deserving of the title Nostromo, part one is about Costaguana, part two the Revolution and only in part three does the reader finally become fully acquainted with Gian'' Battista, or Nostromo as he is named by the upper class of Sulaco.');

In a few months he will have the chance to shed his shadowguard and bind himself to an adult shadowspirit. Unfortunately because of an unfortunate series of events Tal may not be able to receive a shadow spirit. You see he cannot go through the ceremony unless he has a primary sunstone and because his father has disappeared he has very few ways of receiving this sunstone. Even more serious is his mother''s health. Tal''s mother is very sick and the only thing that can help her is the light of a sunstone. Tal knows that if he doesn''t find a primary sunstone, chances are she will die. This sends young Tal out on a dangerous journey through the castle he lives in. He knows that he only has so much time and must do anything he can to receive this primary sunstone. Unfortunately people seem to be working against his quest to receive a sunstone. It looks like his only hope is to steal a sunstone, and the only way he can do that is to climb up the castle and penetrate the mysterious vale where the sunstones are stored.Garth Nix is probably best known for his dark YA series (starting with Sabriel) that takes you into a mysterious world known as the old Kingdom where the Abhorsen is peoples only protection against dangerous necromancers. The Fall, the first book of the Seven Towers series looks to have some things in common with Sabriel and it''s predecessors. It''s filled with fascinating characters and dark and mysterious creatures. It has a strong female character and a new and original world. The Castle is a mysterious place where what you''re class is means everything. Unfortunately, it''s not quite as gripping and addicting as Sabriel, possibly because it''s written in a much different style. The Seventh Tower series was made for a much younger audience so it doesn''t posses the enthralling descriptions and complex characterization as Sabriel. Still the book is very good. It''s fast paced, exciting, and interesting to read. Tal is a very amiable character.

The book is not beholden to the stereotypes of male strength and violence and  female compassion, as one typically finds.  Rather, both genders portray a  complete range of personalities; from the compassionate male hero to the  violent girl (Milla) that wants to kill Tal but resists out of loyalty to  her clan and because she gave her word to her clan''s (female) leader.  The  story line itself is interesting and shows no inconsistencies that leave  the reader wondering if the book was ever edited.  This the first book in a  total of six in the series.  My only complaint is that this book is not a  complete story in and of itself as are the Harry Potter books or Ursula Le  Guin''s Earthsea series.  It leaves the reader hanging at the end with no  idea of when part two will be written.  But that is a minor complaint and  inspite of that I highly recommend it.  In todays world it''s important that  boys have compassionate male heros and understand that females can be just  as violent as males.  Likewise, girls have to understand that boys aren''t  weak just because they aren''t physical and that girls can be strong both  physically and mentally.  Of course, the book also has it''s share of  underhanded people (both male and female) along with the snobs, the cheats,  the genius teetering on the edge of insanity and plenty of fantasy  creatures to round it out.

I don''t know either, but probably not this hushed, elegiac novel. It''s not the brooding melancholy of "Across the River and Into the Trees" itself that''s surprising - it''s that the book contains no action and no climax of pretty much any sort, and that it still manages to be so good.Essentially, the book is the restless consciousness of one Richard Cantwell, Colonel in the United States Army, veteran of two world wars, recipient of many grave wounds, who is travelling through Europe one last time to shoot some ducks, meet some old friends, and spend a couple of days with his last, real and only love, a nineteen-year-old (!) countess named Renate. The book is aptly titled - it flows like a quiet old river, slowly but surely and a bit sadly. Like many a Hemingway hero, Cantwell is stuck with an empty existence, a profession he doesn''t much care for, and awareness of both of the above. Love Renate though he does, he lives in the past, constantly reliving this and that battle, moving imaginary troops one minute, then wondering about the meaning of it all the next.Renate herself is the least realistic of all Hemingway women, and as a female lead she''s poor indeed. That is not, however, the way she should be seen. She is described as having almost unworldly gentleness and purity, an enormous contrast to the colonel (esp. given her youth). In a way, she becomes almost a symbol of the youth the colonel has irrevocably lost, an epitome of everything he missed out on - and the stories of the battles he tells her become almost like religious confessions. In the end, Cantwell ruefully realizes that he cannot tell her everything, that she could not possibly understand all the sorrows he suffered and never was freed from, that he thus cannot be redeemed, and the book ends on a funereal note.Lack of action notwithstanding, the poignant, honest self-analysis and wistful tone make this book beautiful in the same way a stately, quiet funeral dirge is. Cantwell is likely Hemingway''s most autobiographical character - indeed, we get further inside his head than we did in Jake Barnes''s, or Robert Jordan''s, or Harry Morgan''s - and probably well reflects Hemingway''s own state of mind at the time. In the long mental soliloquys about politics, Europe, war and life in general, the line between author and character disappears. Indeed, it''s difficult to imagine an American officer (of such rank) thinking in such terms - no, this is Hemingway himself, writing down his thoughts and feelings and donning a colonel''s uniform for the occasion. And if you felt like that, you might well have come to the same conclusion the author did.');

While his lean style and powerful undercurrent of emotions make novels such as The Sun Also Rises  unforgettable, this book epitomizes everything that was flawed in  Hemingway''s later writings.The book is pure drivel. The dialogue is  stilted, the setting (Venice) is not effectively portrayed, and there is a  noticeable lack of action. The protagonist, The Colonel, is an older, sick  hero of two wars who has reunited with a much younger, wealthy lover in  Venice. He is a proud and noble man, and I think Hemingway is trying here  to portray the character''s anguish at his lost youth and his inability to  live in the virile fashion of a typical Hemingway male. However, if you  want understatement and concise dialogue with real human emotions, read the  novels of Howard Norman like the Bird Artist or The Museum Guard. If you  like Hemingway and want better examples of his later period, stick to A  Moveable Feast or even Green Hills of Africa, at least they are  entertaining and have actual stories to tell. I still think that  Hemingway''s short stories and his first novel, The Sun Also Rises,  represent the author at the peak of his creative powers. Across the River  and Into the Trees is painful to read, and is only given a bit of literary  attention due to the reputation of the author.

Tal and Milla seperate early in the book, and Tal is the main focus through most of it, which means loads of character development for him.  The author writes each character, though particulerly Tal in this book, not as a thirteen year old boy, but as a human being, caught in frightening events, and handed burdons that seem impossible to bear.  Thus, every time Tal triumphs, it seems a triumph to the reader as well, rather than a predictable outcome.  But, despite the excellently developed characters, this book is mainly about action and plot, which is written just as well.

Meg''s mom keeps the home fires burning, but never lets on to the children her fears. Charles Wallace was just a baby when his father left, now he''s in school. And then there''s Meg - not cool like the other girls, not beautiful, too outspoken and smart to fit in her class, she worries that her father has died. Throw Calvin, a sort of popular boy from school into this mix and you got the makings of an adventure. (The twins show up in this book, but later they are showcased more.)Meg and company set out ot find her father, which turns out to be a lot harder than it looks - and it looks pretty darn hard!The other books continue the adventures of this group, as the characters age and other things come along to upset their world.The books are set up as a classic good versus evil, but it never feels preachy or didactic and you will be swept away in the current of the stories. I highly recommend this for girls as it shows a protagonist who isn''t cool or popular and how she handles things - not so well at times. My sons loved it, too so I know other boys would like it.

Also like previous installments, "The Silver Chair" brings back familiar characters while also introducing new cast members, lending the story an air of familiarity while still remaining fresh.In this installment Eustace, the ill-mannered lad who learned the error of his ways in "The Voyage of the Dawn Treader," along with his schoolmate, Jill, pair up for adventure. While fleeing bullies at their school - a progressive and modern (for its time) institution that Lewis openly and repeatedly scorns - Eustace and Jill find themselves thrown into the world of Narnia. Once there, Aslan gives Jill a series of vague instructions to follow during their adventure.Eustace and Jill find themselves on a quest to find the lost Prince Rillian, the son of King Caspian (who in this tale makes two brief cameos as an old man). They team up with Puddleglum, a gloomy a creature called a Marsh-Wiggle who always sees the down side of things. Together, the three go in search of the Prince.The setup tells the reader right off what sort of story it will be: a traveling adventure in which the group works through a series of dangerous situations and visits new and strange lands. The story takes a few chapters to get moving properly, shortening the main quest; there are only three or so key locations. Still, those locations are a mix of classic genre archetypes and fantastic settings. For an important segment of the story - a castle of giants - genre archetypes rule the day."Silver Chair," though it visits places in Narnia not previously seen, feels less epic than previous installments. However, a glimpse of a greater and more wondrous world near the end helps alleviate that failing.The character of Jill undergoes almost the same transformation that Eustace did in "Voyage," while Eustace himself plays the role that Edmund, Peter and the gang did in earlier books. That''s not altogether bad, but it''s not altogether good, either, especially if you are reading the whole series straight through. because Jill''s transformation immediately follows Eustace''s.All in all, "The Silver Chair" is not as engaging as others in the series, with a loose plot tied together largely by a "you must trust Aslan" theme, but does not fall nearly as flat as "Caspian." For a good stretch the story moves along at a brisk pace and offers a playful series of adventures, delivering just the sort of engaging story that makes the Narnia Chronicles such a beloved series. Sure it suffers from too slow a start and too slow a finish, both which drag the story down, but at its core it''s more of the same from Narnia. And that''s not a bad thing at all.');

The stories are wonderfully written and will engage you like few other works.  Part spiritual allegory and part fantasy and adventure, these stories are timeless.My personal favorite of the 7 stories is this one:  The Silver Chair.  Starting with the unexpected trip into Narnia, the story involves the search for a missing prince and a dangerous and exciting journey to find him.  While the plot is quickly engaging and always enjoyable, even after dozens of readings, in this story Lewis uses some of the most powerful of Christian allegories to depict faith, deception, and courage.  Choices made along the way are often disastrous and are the result of convenience and comfort over faith.  Truly a sound statement into our own journeys, and a spiritual struggle depicted accurately.I will not spoil the plot, but if you have not enjoyed this series, pick up any of the seven books, or better yet get them all at once.  The story starts either with "The Lion, The Witch, and the Wardrobe" which was the first published, or "The Magician''s Nephew" which is chronologically the first.  Either way, you won''t be disappointed.  Next to "The Silver Chair", I also found "The Horse and His Boy" and "Voyage of the Dawn Treader" to be absolute classics.Buy this series, and enjoy one of the true treasures in literature from a fabulous writer, the world renowned CS Lewis.');

The central theme of this book seems to be the importance of belief (religious or otherwise; I suppose it depends on how you define religion). Nevertheless, the book is not too esoteric, like the other Chronicles, the plot functions perfectly well on a surface level. In short, the plot concerns two children who are given a task in Narnia. Before returning a king who has disappeared, they must battle giants and a witch, as well as escape from an underground world.I say this book is about belief because the children are given several immediate tasks which they are told to pursue even though the long term goal and result is not revealed to them. Given the adversity and temptation the children meet along the way, pursuit of the tasks requires a great deal of faith and perseverance. The children are even exposed to willful deceit and witchcraft. Just as they begin to falter, they always receive help from somewhere. This to me is one of the great things about these books; children are both shown to be capable of accomplishing much and shown that if their intentions are good they can expect to receive help along the way. One may ask whether this approach will give children excessive expectations of the world, but I say better to give children hope than a sense of futility, since I believe children are indeed strong, strong enough to suffer the inevitable dashing of hopes.

Secondly it is a true (and much more direct) sequel to "Ghosts of Onyx", Eric Nylund''s most recent Halo novel.  Karen Traviss (who wrote Gears of War 3) takes the reigns from Nylund and runs with them though, balancing three storylines of complex moral ambiguity and intrigue. The moral implications of Dr. Halsey''s actions are explored in great detail, and while I had previously been a strong Halsey supporter (her journal that came with the Reach legendary edition is what got me reading Halo fiction in the first place), several characters have strong arguments for the "Halsey is a Monster" camp.  So we follow Halsey and the group of Spartan IIs and IIIs trapped in the Onyx Dyson sphere (the Forerunner "shield" world that they escape to in "Ghosts of Onyx)" as well as a group of ONI spooks and a few Sangheili (elites) rogues who are plotting a mutiny against the Arbiter. If nothing else, Glasslands proves that the end of the covenant war is by no means the end of interesting stories to be told in the Halo universe. In fact, it has convinced me that now that the cut and dry "good humans vs. army of evil mutants" conflict is resolved, we can now get into the meaty aftermath that has the potential to tell much more complex stories. Here we have elites who want peace with humans, elites who don''t want peace with humans, humans who want to reignite the insurrection against the UNSC, humans who want to spark a civil war between the two factions of elites, jackals who want to return to being the pirates of space and the possibility of a new (or more likely OLD) faction that I have a strong inkling will play a big part in the story for Halo 4 (if the Terminal videos in Halo: CEA are any indication). If you''ve never read a Halo book before, I''d recommend reading the Nylund books ("Fall of Reach", "First Strike" and "Ghosts of Onyx")  before "Glasslands"  as the Spartans'' storyline runs through all of these books ("The Flood" is part of that arc also, but you can just play Halo 1 to get the jist of that story) but if you make it though those three, Glasslands is a real treat.

It starts innocently enough - some simple-sounding problems on socks in drawers, flipping coins, and rolling dice.  Soon enough, you end up with paper black with numbers and pictures of a flipping coin (how thick does a coin need to be so that it lands on its =side= with probability 1/3?)  If you get drawn in deep (as I did), you may even wonder what probability really means.Some of the problems are classic, such as the problem of how many people would it take for the probability that at least two of them have the same birthday is greater than a half (I''ll give this answer away: 23.  But do you know why?)  One of the dice problems actually recalls the history of the development of probability as a separate mathematical field -- problem #19, involving dice bets that Samuel Pepys asked Isaac Newton to figure out.  Some of the problems are simply openers for entire vistas in probability - avoid problems #51 and #52 if you wish to not become enmeshed in concerns of random walks (remember that one of Einstein''s earliest papers was on Brownian motion - a molecular random walk.)  I used problem #25, which deal with "random chords on a circle", to explore this classic probability paradox - I''ve ended up with three different figures, all of which seem plausible!  It gets deep to what one means by "random chord".This book, though so thin, is inexhaustible in spawning disturbing questions about probability; even more useful is that there are questions for people at =any= level of knowledge of probability.  Those who wish to think about "counting" problems (like those involving rolling dice, or pulling balls out of urns) will find those here.

It is Nietzsche''s most sustained critique of the negative, reactive values of Christianity.On his readers:"This book belongs to the very few. Perhaps none of them is even living yet. Possibly they are the readers who understand my Zarathustra: how could I confound myself with those for whom there are ears listening today? Only the day after tomorrow belongs to me. Some are born posthumously."On monotono-theism:"Almost two millennia and not a single new God! But still, this pitiful God of Christian monotono-theism. This hybrid of the void, conceptualism and contradiction, this picture of decay, in which all decadence instincts, all cowardliness and weariness of soul have their sanction!""We have learned better. We have become more modest in every respect. We no longer trace the origin of man in the `spirit'', in the `divinity'', we have placed him back among the animals. We consider him the strongest animal because he is the most cunning: his spirituality is a consequence of this. On the other hand, we guard ourselves against a vanity which would like to find expression even here: that man is the secret objective of animal evolution. Man is absolutely not the crown of creation: every creature stands beside him at the same stage of perfection. And even in asserting that we assert too much: man is, relatively speaking, the most unsuccessful animal, the sickliest, the one most dangerously strayed from its instincts.""Formerly one saw in man''s consciousness, in his `spirit'', the proof of his higher origin, his divinity;  to make himself perfect man was advised to draw his senses back into himself in the manner of the tortoise, to cease to have any traffic with the earthly, to lay aside his mortal frame: then the chief part of him would remain behind, `pure spirit.'' We have thought better of this too: becoming-conscious, `spirit'', is to us precisely a symptom of a relative imperfection of the organism, as an attempting, fumbling, blundering, as a toiling in which an unnecessarily large amount of nervous energy is expended - we deny that anything can be made perfect so long as it is still made conscious. `Pure spirit'' is pure stupidity.""The word `Christianity'' is already a misunderstanding. In reality there has only been one Christian, and he died on the cross. The `Christian'', that which has been called Christian for two millennia, is merely a psychological misunderstanding."Even with the most modest claim to integrity one must know today that a theologian, a priest, a pope does not merely err in every sentence he speaks, he lies. The priest knows as well as anyone that there is no longer any `God'', any `sinner'', any `redeemer.'' All the concepts of the church are recognized for what they are: the most malicious counterfeiting there is for the purpose of disparaging nature and natural values; the priest himself is recognized for what he is: the most dangerous kind of parasite, the real poisonous spider of life. The concepts `Beyond'', `Last Judgement'', `immortality of the soul'',  the `soul'' itself; they are instruments of torture, they are forms of systematic cruelty by virtue of which the priest has become master, stays master."On the stupidity of the "Gospels":"That strange and sick world to which the Gospels introduce us - a world like that of a Russian novel, in which the refuse of society, neurosis and childish idiocy seem to make a rendez-vous... One has to regret that no Dostoyevsky lived in the neighbourhood, I mean someone who could feel the thrilling fascination of the sublime, the sick and the childish.""A certain sense of cruelty towards oneself and others is Christian; hatred of those who think differently; the will to persecute. Mortal hostility against the masters of the earth, against the noble (one allows them the body, one wants only `the soul''). Hatred of mind, of pride, courage, freedom, libertinage is Christian; hatred of the senses, of the joy of the senses, of joy in general is Christian.""In Christianity, neither morality nor religion come into contact with reality at any point. Nothing but imaginary causes (`God'', `soul'', `ego'', `spirit'', `free will''), nothing but imaginary effect(`sin'', `redemption'', `grace'', `punishment'', `forgiveness of sins'').  Relationships among imaginary beings (`God'', `spirits'', `souls''); an imaginary natural science (anthropocentric; complete lack of the concept of natural causes); an imaginary psychology (nothing but self-misunderstandings, interpretations of pleasant or unpleasant general feelings), an imaginary teleology (`the kingdom of God'', `the Last Judgement'', `eternal life'').This purely fictitious world is distinguished from the world of dreams, very much to its disadvantage, by the fact that the latter mirrors reality, while the former falsifies, devalues and denies reality.  Once the concept `nature'' had been devised as the concept antithetical to `God'', `natural'' had to be the world for `reprehensible''. This entire fictional world has its roots in hatred of the natural (reality!), it is the expression of a profound discontent with reality.""Pure spirit is pure lie. So long as the priest, that denier, slanderer and poisoner of life by profession, still counts as a higher kind of human being, there can be no answer to the question: what is truth? One has already stood truth on its head when the conscious advocate of denial and nothingness counts as the `re-presentative of Truth''."On Epicurus vs. "Saint" Paul:"One must read Lucretius to understand what it was Epicurus opposed: not paganism but `Christianity'', which is to say the corruption of souls through the concepts of `guilt'', `punishment'' and `immortality''. He opposed the subterranean cults, the whole of latent Christianity - to deny immortality was already in those days a real redemption. - And Epicurus would have won, every mind of every account in the Roman Empire was an Epicurean: then Paul appeared.""What Paul himself did not believe was believed by the idiots among whom he cast his teaching. His requirement was power; with Paul the priest again sought power - he could employ only those concepts, teachings, symbols with which one tyrannizes over masses, forms herds.""Christianity makes a thousand promises but keeps none. On the heels of the `glad tidings'' came the worst of all: those of Paul. In Paul was embodied the antithetical type to the `bringer of glad tidings'', the genius of hatred, of the vision of hatred, of the inexorable logic of hatred. What did this dysangelist not sacrifice to his hatred!The redeemer above all: he nailed him to his cross. The life, the example, the teaching, the death, the meaning and the right of the entire gospel - nothing was left once this hate-obsessed counterfeiter had grasped what he alone could make use of. Not the reality, not the historical truth.""Everything well-constituted, proud, high-spirited, beauty above all, is hurtful to Christian eyes and ears. I recall the saying of Paul: `God hath chosen the weak things of the world, the foolish things of the world, base things of the world, and things which are despised,'': that was the formula. God on the cross, is the fearful hidden meaning behind this symbol still understood? Everything that suffers, everything that hangs on the cross is divine. Christianity was a victory, a nobler disposition perished by it. Christianity has been up till now mankind''s greatest misfortune.""In my Genealogy of Morals I introduced for the first time the psychology of the antithetical concepts of a noble morality and a ressentiment morality, the latter deriving from a denial of the former: but this latter corresponds totally to Judeo-Christian morality. To be able to reject all that represents the ascending movement of life, well-constitutedness, power, beauty, self-affirmation on earth, the instinct of ressentiment here become genius had to invent `another world'' from which that Life Affirmation would appear evil, reprehensible."On Christianity as the breeding of a sick herd:"The problem I raise here is not what ought to succeed mankind in the sequence of species, but what type of human being one ought to breed, ought to will, as more valuable, more worthy of life, more certain of the future.This more valuable type has existed often enough already: but as a lucky accident, as an exception, never as willed. He has rather been the most feared, he has hitherto been virtually the thing to be feared - and out of fear the reverse type has been willed, bred, achieved: the domestic animal, the herd animal, the sick animal, the Christian.""One should not embellish or dress up Christianity: it has waged a war to the death against the higher type of man, it has excommunicated all the fundamental instincts of this type, it has distilled evil, the `evil one'', out of these instincts - the strong human being as the type of reprehensibility, as the `outcast.'' Christianity has taken the side of everything weak, base, ill-constituted, it has made an ideal out of opposition to the preservative instincts of strong life; it has depraved the reason even of the intellectually strongest natures by teaching men to feel the supreme values of intellectuality as sinful, as misleading, as temptations.""I call an animal, a species, an individual depraved when it chooses, when it prefers, what is harmful to it. I consider life itself instinct for growth, for continuance, for accumulation of forces, for power: where the will to power is lacking there is decline.""Christianity is called the religion of pity. Pity stands in antithesis to the heathy emotions  which enhance the energy of the feeling of life:  it has a depressive effect. One loses force when one pities. The loss of force which life has already sustained through suffering is increased and multiplied even further by pity. Suffering itself becomes contagious through pity.This depressive and contagious instinct thwarts those instincts bent on preserving and enhancing the value of life: both as a multiplier of misery and as a conservator of everything miserable it is one of the chief instruments for the advancement of décadence - pity persuades to nothingness! One does not say nothingness - one says `the Beyond'' or `God'' or `True life''.""What a theologian feels to be true must be false: this provides almost a criterion of truth. It is his deepest instinct of self-preservation which forbids any part of reality whatever to be held in esteem or even spoken of. Wherever the influence of the theologian extends value judgement is stood on its head, the concepts `true'' and `false'' are necessarily reversed: that which is most harmful to life is here called `true,'' that which enhances, intensifies, affirms, justifies it and causes it to triumph is called `false''.""When the prerequisites of ascending life, when everything strong, brave, masterful, proud is eliminated from the concept of God; when he declines step by step to the symbol of a staff for the weary, a sheet-anchor for all who are drowning; when he becomes the poor people''s God, the sinner''s God, the God of the sick par excellence, and the predicate `saviour'', `redeemer'' as it were remains over as the predicate of divinity as such: of what does such a transformation speak? Such a reduction of the divine?""The Christian conception of God - God as God of the sick, God as spider, God as spirit - is one of the most corrupt conceptions of God arrived at on earth: perhaps it even represents the low-water mark in the descending development of the God type. God degenerated to the contradiction of life,  instead of being its transfiguration and eternal Yes! In God a declaration of hostility toward life, nature, the will to life! God, the formula for every slander of this world, for every lie about `the next world''. In God nothingness deified, the will to nothingness sanctified.""If one shifts the center of gravity of life out of life into `the Beyond'' - into nothingness - one has deprived life itself of its center of gravity. The great lie of personal immortality destroys all rationality, all naturalness of instinct - all that is salutary, all that is life-furthering, all that holds a guarantee of the future in the instincts henceforth excites mistrust. So to live as if there is no longer any meaning in living: that now becomes the meaning of life.""What sets us apart is not that we recognize no god, either in history or in nature or behind nature - but that we find that which has been revered as `God'' not godlike, but pitiful, absurd, harmful, not merely an error, but a crime against Life."');

He portrays Christianity in gory  detail as the religion of revenge, dishonesty, small-mindedness and pity  which it is, and a leading cause of the west''s descent into nihilism. (A  reading of this book almost forms a mini spiritual biography of  western  civilisation of the last three centuries). The adherence to a religion like  Christianity forms a sort of enslavement to an outdated meaning system thus  causing anyone with a scrap of intellectual integrity to lie to theirselves  as a means of supporting a bankrupt world-view and  while appropriate for  Zarathustra''s "last men", is death for all higher types, and had  waged a bitter war against all manner of vitality, stregnth and honour  which are the hallmarks of die ubermensche. He talks of the  psychology of  the priest and the natural hatred of science that they all possess as well  as the slave morality and cowardice that Christianity promotes, but for all  the vim that the book possesses, it is not a very scholarly work, and  contains many errors. Nietzsche understandably finds it difficult to  restrain himself, but this gives the work a sort of amateurish tone.  Mencken has done a wonderful job here -- all the more because he had a deep  appreciation for Nietzsche -- the man and his work. For those who cannot  understand Nietzsche''s "hatred" of Christianity, I would  recommend a very thorough reading of the Geneology of Morals, which goes  into much greater detail and is much more scholarly and will provide better  insight into the anti-Chrsitian perspective.

His work is cutting edge, unique, and always shocking. Each of his works is unique, from other authors and from his own works. Palahniuk has an incredibly imaginative and creative mind. The closest authors to him are: in Canada Douglas Coupland and in the UK Irvine Welsh. But the problem with always shocking and being so unique is each new work must outdo the previous. As such I think I have lost my taste for Palahniuk''s writings.The book is unique, different and well-written. It is the story of Pygmy, one of a group of youths from a totalitarian state that has been sent to the United States, to live with Christian families and experience a better life. At least that is what the Host Families and church believe. Yet in reality these youths have been raised from a young age as agents of the state, part of a planned terrorist attack on the States.Palahniuk does a great job of dissecting Midwestern life through foreign eyes. It is a satire both of America''s fears and of America itself. However the story is just too much - male rape, high school massacre, planned seductions, pregnancies and impregnations. And the whole book is written as a series of dispatches from Pygmy to his home government, written in a halting, misunderstood English. Palahniuk captures a feel about the language, yet still conveys his message.Palahniuk''s books are usually a pleasure to read and so addictive that I cannot put them down. Some I have read more than once, even back to back - finished it and started reading it again. That was not the case this time. Twice I put it down for a few days, and was uncertain I would pick it up again to finish it. This was the first Palahniuk book I have read that I easily predicted the ending; that, in and of itself, was a disappointment. As a book it is okay, but as a Palahniuk book it is disappointing on many levels. For the hardcore Palahniuk fans out there - they will love it. I think I have just lost my taste for his extremism.(First Published in Imprint 2009-05-29.)');

J. Ayer, G. E. Moore, and Ludwig Wittgenstein, one has to place Russell in the foreground as the philosophers'' philosopher. He writes with clarity and lucidity. His concerns are largely logical and epistemological. And this book centers around his principal concerns.I doubt that Russell would write this same book today, but I also doubt that he would fundamentally alter the positions he takes, if he were writing today. There is something neat, eloquent, and elegant about his epistemological premises that make this work (well beyond its 17th printing and more than eighty years old) such a venerable treasure trove. Could his positions be better articulated? Yes, but not by much. Would he delve more deeply into logic? Almost certainly. And he does, in other books written during his lifetime.This book is really for the novice. My only complaint is that the novice will probably remain lost if his readings did not encompass more logic and criticism of rational and empirical epistemology. What makes Russell a true "modern" in contemporary philosophy is his bridge to resolving both the rationalist and empiricist schools of thought. One not knowing these dichotomies might find Russell''s resolution difficult to follow. Elsewhere in the book, Russell identifies "three" rules of thought, when these rules are no longer considered all that are extent. Generally, there are seven, sometimes nine, taught in most symbolic logic courses, and this discrepancy may needlessly cause confusion. So while the book is written for the novice, it bears re-reading after covering other contemporary writers.Russell and the others mentioned above are often associated with logical atomism, either directly or indirectly. Reading Russell or Ayer gives the student the best opportunity to do philosophy whilst learning it first hand. Both are explicit writers with Ayer perhaps having the upper hand. But, as with any philosophical school, such as logical atomism, there is always a counter reaction, and A. L. Austin''s "Sense and Sensibility" is just such a reproach. Russell, like Ayer, uses the construct of "sense data" to explain the theory of knowledge; Austin and Gilbert Ryle redress both author''s use of such "metaphysical" interpolations, which makes for an interesting contrast. Any reader of Russell or Ayer should counterbalance his reading with Austin''s work."The Problems of Philosophy" is not without gaps that may leave the reader puzzled by the omissions. Perhaps they weren''t as obvious when Russell wrote this book, but they are clearer now in hindsight. An egregious omission is the absence of anything to do with ethics or moral theory. Since ethics is one of the few domains particular to philosophy alone, this omission is particularly troublesome in a book of this name.

For many, just the word "philosophy" evokes images of ancient thinkers, yet not in a very appealing light: old men sitting around, absent-mindedly stroking their chins as they ponder the meaning of life. Yet, philosophy does not deserve this reputation. It is not just some hobby for stodgy elders, or those with nothing better to do. Rather, it is quite the opposite; it is an endlessly intriguing subject, one which causes you to consider things you may have never thought of before. Survive the test, and the reaffirmation that results will be worth it.Philosophy contains no easy answers. It poses a myriad of questions which can force one to doubt, and even reexamine, one''s beliefs -- even those which previously seemed so resolute. This may at first be difficult or discombobulating, but persistance is rewarded with an even stronger foundation than before.I will not attempt to summarize this book, as people before me have already explained it sufficiently. However, I will say that this book was a great influence, and a wonderful introduction to the world of philosophy. For such an abstruse and "deep" matter, one would think that most would be intimidated; however, Russell handles it splendidly.

PI 126"The more narrowly we examine actual language, the sharper becomes the conflict between it and our requirement. (For the crystalline purity of logic was, of course, not a result of investigation: it was a requirement.)"PI 107"The wrong conception which I want to object to in this connexion is the following, that we can discover something wholly new. That is a mistake. The truth of the matter is that we have already got everything, and that we have got it actually present; we need not wait for anything. We make our moves in the realm of the grammar of our ordinary language, and this grammar is already there. Thus, we have already got everything and need not wait for the future." (said in 1930) Waismann "Ludwig Wittgenstein and the Vienna Circle (1979)p183"Here we come up against a remarkable and characteristic phenomenon in philosophical investigation: the difficulty---I might say---is not that of finding the solution but rather that of recognizing as the solution something that looks as if it were only a preliminary to it. We have already said everything.---Not anything that follows from this, no this itself is the solution!....This is connected, I believe, with our wrongly expecting an explanation, whereas the solution of the difficulty is a description, if we give it the right place in our considerations. If we dwell upon it, and do not try to get beyond it." Zettel p312-314Here is how the leading Wittgenstein scholar summarized his work: "Wittgenstein resolved many of the deep problems that have dogged our subject for centuries, sometimes indeed for more than two millennia, problems about the nature of linguistic representation, about the relationship between thought and language, about solipsism and idealism, self-knowledge and knowledge of other minds, and about the nature of necessary truth and of mathematical propositions. He ploughed up the soil of European philosophy of logic and language. He gave us a novel and immensely fruitful array of insights into philosophy of psychology. He attempted to overturn centuries of reflection on the nature of mathematics and mathematical truth. He undermined foundationalist epistemology. And he bequeathed us a vision of philosophy as a contribution not to human knowledge, but to human understanding - understanding of the forms of our thought and of the conceptual confusions into which we are liable to fall."--Peter Hacker--''Gordon Baker''s late interpretation of Wittgenstein''I would add that W was the first (by 40 years) to clearly and extensively describe the two systems of thought (fast and slow thinking now central to psychology). He explained how behavior only is possible with a vast inherited background that is the axiomatic basis for judging and cannot be doubted or judged, so will (choice), consciousness self, time and space are innate true-only axioms. He also discussed many times what is now known as Theory of Mind, Framing and cognitive illusions and can thus be viewed as the first evolutionary psychologist. He described the psychology behind what later became the Wason test--a fundamental measure used in EP decades later. He noted the indeterminate nature of language and the game-like nature of social interaction. He examined in thousands of pages and hundreds of examples how our inner mental experiences are not describable in language, this being possible only for behavior with a public language (the impossibility of private language). He described and refuted the notions of the mind as machine and the computational theory of mind, long before practical computers. He invented truth tables and predicted paraconsistent logic. He decisively laid to rest skepticism and metaphysics. He showed that, far from being inscrutable, the activities of the mind lie open before us, a lesson few have learned since.When thinking about Wittgenstein, I often recall the comment attributed to Cambridge Philosophy professor C.D. Broad (who did not understand nor like him). "Not offering the chair of philosophy to Wittgenstein would be like not offering the chair of physics to Einstein!" I think of him as the Einstein of intuitive psychology. Though born ten years later, he was likewise hatching ideas about the nature of reality at nearly the same time and in the same part of the world and like Einstein nearly died in WW1. Now suppose Einstein was a suicidal homosexual recluse with a difficult personality who published only one early version of his ideas that were confused and often mistaken, but became world famous; completely changed his ideas but for the next 30 years published nothing more, and knowledge of his new work, in mostly garbled form, diffused slowly from occasional lectures and students notes; that he died in 1951 leaving behind over 20,000 pages of mostly handwritten scribblings in German, composed of sentences or short paragraphs with, often, no clear relationship to sentences before or after; that these were cut and pasted from other notebooks written years earlier with notes in the margins, underlinings and crossed out words, so that many sentences have multiple variants; that his literary executives cut this indigestible mass into pieces, leaving out what they wished and struggling with the monstrous task of capturing the correct meaning of sentences which were conveying utterly novel views of how the universe works and that they then published this material with agonizing slowness (not finished after half a century) with prefaces that contained no real explanation of what it was about; that he became as much notorious as famous due to many statements that all previous physics was a mistake and even nonsense, and that virtually nobody understood his work, in spite of hundreds of books and tens of thousands of papers discussing it; that many physicists knew only his early work in which he had made a definitive summation of Newtonian physics stated in such extremely abstract and condensed form that it was difficult to decide what was being said; that he was then virtually forgotten and that most books and articles on the nature of the world and the diverse topics of modern physics had only passing and usually erroneous references to him, and that many omitted him entirely; that to this day, over half a century after his death, there were only a handful of people who really grasped the monumental consequences of what he had done. This, I claim, is precisely the situation with Wittgenstein.Had W lived into his 80''s he would have been able to directly influence Searle (the other modern genius of descriptive psychology), Symons, and countless other students of behavior. If his brilliant friend Frank Ramsey had not died in his youth, a highly fruitful collaboration would almost certainly have ensued. If his student and colleague Alan Turing had become his lover, one of the most amazing collaborations of all time would likely have evolved. In any one case the intellectual landscape of the 20th century would have been different and if all 3 had occurred it would almost certainly have been very different. Instead he lived in relative intellectual isolation, few knew him well or had an inkling of his ideas while he lived, and only a handful within philosophy have any real grasp of his work today. He could have shined as an engineer(he patented helicopter designs which anticipated by three decades the use of blade-tip jets to drive the rotors and which had the seeds of the centrifugal-flow gas turbine engine, a mathematician (he sketched out a proof of Euler''s theorem, since shown to be valid, and grasped the psychological foundations of math , incompleteness, infinity etc., as no one else has to this day), a physiologist (he did wartime research in it and designed a heartbeat monitor), a musician (he played instruments and had a renowned talent for whistling), an architect (the modernist house he designed and constructed for his sister still stands), or an entrepreneur (he inherited one of the largest fortunes in the world but gave it all away). It is a miracle he survived the trenches and prison camps (while writing the Tractatus) in WW1, many years of suicidal depressions (2 brothers succumbed to them), avoided being trapped in Austria and executed by the Nazis (he was partly Jewish), and that he was not persecuted for his homosexuality and driven to suicide like his friend Turing. He realized nobody understood what he was doing and might never (not surprising as he was half a century ahead of psychology and philosophy, which only recently have started accepting that our behavior evolved like our body.)Before TLP there is a ProtoTractatus and a few desultory comments made even earlier. It is a remarkable document which continues to seduce some the best minds in philosophy, with new books and articles dealing partly or entirely with it appearing frequently over a century after it was first conceived. The first thing to note is that W later rejected it entirely for reasons he spent the rest of his life explaining. You can see the review of S Guha on amazon.com for a splendid précis of some of what TLP means IF you assume phrases like "propositions are pictures of reality" have a clear meaning (they don''t). He was doing philosophy (descriptive psychology) as though the mind was a logical mathematical machine that processed facts (i.e., information processing) and behavior was the result. Thus, long before computers W gave the ultimate statement of what was half a century later to become known as Behaviorism, Strong AI, Functionalism, CTM (Computational Theory of Mind) and most recently DST (Dynamic Systems Theory). Eventually, W realized that perception and memory were the raw material acted upon by our innate psychology (EP) and logic and math were some of the results. Being able to say or understand anything presupposed EP and trying to make logic primary (unless one means our axiomatic psychology) leads to incoherence, as is evident throughout TLP (and the explanation for its many bizarre statements-see e.g. Hutto). Even so, one can "understand" TLP in the sense that one can state the confusions he labored under and which most of the world still does.In the decades after TLP, W evolved slowly and his ideas crystallized into a unique and amazingly deep and prescient description of behavior not yet fully appreciated by even his brightest and most ardent admirers (e.g. Hutto, Stern, DMS etc.). Although W wrote thousands of pages and is the most discussed philosopher in modern times, only a few have any real grasp of what he did and how it anticipates in detail many of the latest advances in psychology and philosophy (descriptive psychology). It is essential to first read some of the commentaries on his later work by others. One of the best is that of Daniele Moyal-Sharrock (DMS) whose 2004 volume "Understanding Wittgenstein''s On Certainty" is mandatory for every educated person, and perhaps the best starting point for understanding Wittgenstein, psychology, philosophy and life, since it explains the unconscious, axiomatic structure of animal behavior. Next, I would suggest the writings of Peter Hacker and of Daniel Hutto, especially his "Wittgenstein and the End of Philosophy"(2004). However (in my view) like all analyses, they fall short of grasping his unique and revolutionary advances in describing behavior by failing to put them in a broad evolutionary and contemporary scientific context, which I will attempt in skeletal outline here. Finally, all of Searle should be read, with special attention to his more recent works such as PNC and MSW (see my reviews). Though Searle does not say and seems to be unaware, most of his work follows directly from that of W.To say that Searle has carried on W''s work is not to say that it is a direct result of W study, but rather that because there is only ONE human psychology (for the same reason there is only ONE human cardiology), that anyone accurately describing behavior must be voicing some variant or extension of what W said. I find most of Searle foreshadowed in W, including versions of the famous Chinese room argument against Strong AI.Incidentally, if the Chinese Room interests you then you should read Victor Rodych''s supplement on the CR--"Searle Freed of Every Flaw". Rodych has also written a series of superb papers on W''s philosophy of mathematics --i.e., the EP (Evolutionary Psychology) of the axiomatic System 1 Primary Language Games (PLG''s) of counting as extended into the endless System 2 SLG''s (Secondary Language Games) of math. I will also note that nobody who promotes Strong AI, CTM, DST or Functionalism seems to be aware that W''s Tractatus is the most striking and powerful statement of their viewpoint ever penned (behavior as the logical processing of facts--i.e., information processing). Decades later he described in great detail why CTM was an incoherent description of mind that must be replaced by psychology (or you can say this is all he did for the rest of his life).Wittgenstein (W) is for me easily the most brilliant thinker on human behavior of all time and this is his most famous work. He shows that behavior is an extension of innate true-only axioms (see "On Certainty" for his final extended treatment of this idea) and that our conscious ratiocination emerges from unconscious machinations. His corpus can be seen as the foundation for all description of animal behavior, revealing how the mind works and indeed must work. The "must" is entailed by the fact that all brains share a common ancestry and common genes and so there is only one basic way they work, that this necessarily has an axiomatic structure, that all higher animals share the same evolved psychology based on inclusive fitness, and that in humans this is extended into a personality based on throat muscle contractions (language) that evolved to manipulate others. This book, and arguably all of W''s work and all useful discussion of behavior, is a development of or variation on these ideas. Another major theme here, and of course in all discussion of human behavior, is the need to separate the automatisms from the effects of culture. Though few philosophers, psychologists, anthropologists, sociologists etc., explicitly discuss this, it can be seen as the major problem they are dealing with. I suggest it will prove of the greatest value to consider W''s work and most of his examples as an effort to tease apart not only fast and slow thinking (e.g., perceptions vs dispositions--see below), but nature and nurture.What he laid out in his final period (and throughout his earlier work in a less clear way) are the foundations of evolutionary psychology (EP), or if you prefer, psychology, cognitive linguistics, intentionality, higher order thought or just animal behavior. Few realize that his works are a vast and unique textbook of descriptive psychology that is as relevant now as the day it was written. He is almost universally ignored by psychology and other behavioral sciences and humanities, and even those few in philosophy who have more or less understood him have not carried the analysis to its logical (psychological) conclusion, nor realized the extent of his anticipation of the latest work on EP and cognitive illusions (TOM, framing, the two selves of fast and slow thinking etc.,--see below). His heir apparent, John Searle (S), refers to him periodically and his work can be seen as a straightforward extension of W''s, but he does not really get that this is what he is doing. Other leading W analysts such as Hutto, Horwich, Hacker and Moyal-Sharrock do marvelously but (in my view) stop short of putting him in the center of current psychology, where he certainly belongs.I suggest regarding his corpus as the pioneering effort in EP, seeing that he was describing the two selves and the multifarious language games of fast and slow thinking, and by starting from his 3rd period works and reading backwards to the proto-Tractatus. It seems clear that, insofar as they are coherent and correct, all accounts of behavior ought to translate easily into one another. Thus the recent themes of "Embodied Mind" and "Radical Enactivism" should flow directly from and into W''s work. However few follow his example of avoiding jargon and sticking to perspicuous examples, so even redoubtables like Hutto, Searle and Hacker (see below and my reviews) have to be heavily filtered to see that this is true, and even they do not get how completely W has anticipated the latest work in fast and slow, two-self embodied thinking (potential acting).W can also be regarded as a pioneer in evolutionary cognitive linguistics--the Top Down analysis of the mind and its evolution via the careful analysis of examples of language use in context, exposing the many varieties of language games and the relationships between the primary games of true-only unconscious, axiomatic fast thinking of perception, memory and reflexive emotions and acts (often described as the subcortical and primitive cortical reptilian brain first-self functions), and the later evolved higher cortical dispositional conscious abilities of believing, knowing, thinking etc. that constitute the true or false propositional secondary language games of slow thinking that are the network of cognitive illusions that constitute the second-self personality. He dissects hundreds of language games showing how the true-only perceptions, memories and reflexive actions of system one (S1) grade into the thinking, remembering, and understanding of system two (S2) dispositions, and many of his examples also address the nature/nurture issue explicitly. With this evolutionary perspective, his later works are a breathtaking revelation of human nature that is entirely current and has never been equaled. Many perspectives have heuristic value, but I find that this evolutionary two systems view not only lets me understand W, but cuts like a hot knife through the frozen butter of all discussions of behavior. To repeat Dobzhansky''s famous comment: "Nothing in biology makes sense except in the light of evolution." And nothing in philosophy makes sense except in the light of evolutionary psychology.The failure of even the best thinkers (with a few possible exceptions) to fully grasp W''s significance is partly due to the limited attention "On Certainty" (OC) and his other 3rd period works have received, but even more to the inability to understand how profoundly our view of philosophy, anthropology, sociology, linguistics, politics, law, morals, ethics, religion, aesthetics, literature (all of them being descriptive psychology), alters once we accept this evolutionary point of view. The dead hand of the blank slate view of behavior still rests heavily and is the default of the second self of slow thinking conscious S2,(which is oblivious to the fact that the groundwork for all behavior lies in the unconscious, fast thinking axiomatic structure of S1). S1 is more or less equivalent to "mirroring"(Goldman), "neural resonance"(Gallagher), "biosemantics"(Millikan), and "biosemiotics"(Hutto). Steven Pinker''s brilliant `The Blank Slate: the modern denial of human nature'' is highly recommended preparation, even though it is now dated and limited in various ways, and he has no clue about Wittgenstein, and hence of what can be regarded as the first and best really deep investigation into the foundations of human nature. Also, he seems not to grasp that the Blank Slate view is an expression of the cognitive illusions that constitute our mental life.The common ideas (e.g., the subtitle of one of Pinker''s books "The Stuff of Thought: language as a window into human nature") that language is a window on or some sort of translation of our thinking or even (Fodor) that there must be some other "Language of Thought" of which it is a translation, were rejected by W, who tried to show, with hundreds of continually reanalyzed perspicacious examples of language in action, that language is not just the best picture we can ever get of thinking, the mind and human nature, but speech is the mind, and his whole corpus can be regarded as the development of this idea. He rejected the idea that the Bottom Up approaches of physiology, experimental psychology and computation (now we say Computational Theory of Mind, Strong AI, Dynamic Systems Theory, etc.) could reveal what his Top Down deconstructions of Language Games (LG''s) did. The difficulties he noted are to understand what is always in front of our eyes and to capture vagueness ("The greatest difficulty in these investigations is to find a way of representing vagueness" LWPP1, 347). And so, speech is the mind, which is expressed by acoustic blasts about past, present and future acts (i.e., our speech using the later evolved Secondary Language Games (SLG''s) of the Second Self--the dispositions --imagining, knowing, meaning, believing, intending etc.). As with his other aphorisms I suggest one should take seriously his comment that even if God could look into our mind he could not see what we are thinking--this should be the motto of the Embodied Mind.Some of W''s favorite topics in his later second and his third periods are the interdigitating mechanisms of fast and slow thinking (System 1 and 2), the automaticity of our personality, the impossibility of private language and the axiomatic structure of behavior. System 1 is our involuntary fast thinking, true only, nonpropositional, untestable mental states- our perceptions and memories and involuntary acts (including S1 Truths and UA1-Understanding of Agency1), while the evolutionarily later S2 is slow thinking, testable true or false, propositional, Truth2 and UA2, dispositional (and often counterfactual) imagining, supposing, intending, thinking, knowing, believing etc. A useful heuristic is to separate behavior and experience into Intentionality 1 and Intentionality 2 (e.g., Thinking 1 and Thinking 2 etc.) and even into Truths 1 (T only axioms) and Truths 2 (empirical extensions or "Theorems" which in some cases can be False). He recognized that `Nothing is Hidden''--i.e., our whole psychology and all the answers to all philosophical questions are here in our language (our life) and that the difficulty is not to find the answers but to recognize them as always here in front of us--we just have to stop trying to look deeper and to abandon the myth of introspective access to our "inner life" (e.g., "The greatest danger here is wanting to observe oneself." LWPP1, 459).W makes these points throughout his works in countless examples and again his whole corpus can be regarded as the effort to make them clear. After all, what exactly is the alternative? W showed over and over that standard ways of describing behavior (i.e., most of philosophy, and much of descriptive psychology, anthropology, sociology, economics, etc.) are either demonstrably false or incoherent. Once we understand W, we realize the absurdity of regarding "language philosophy" as a separate study apart from other areas of behavior, since language is just another name for the mind. W famously said "The confusion and barrenness of psychology is not to be explained by calling it a `young science'' --but he was not antiscientific--cf. another comment that I have never seen quoted "Is scientific progress useful to philosophy? Certainly. The realities that are discovered lighten the philosophers task. Imagining possibilities." (LWPP1, 807). So, he is not legislating the boundaries of science but pointing out that our behavior (mostly speech) is the clearest picture possible of our psychology and that all discussions of higher order behavior are plagued by conceptual confusions. FMRI, PET, TCMS, iRNA, computational analogs, AI and all the rest are fascinating ways to examine our innate axiomatic psychology, but all they can do is provide the physical basis for our behavior, which remains unchanged. The true-only axioms most thoroughly explored in `''On Certainty'''' are W''s (and later Searle''s) "bedrock" or "background", which we now call evolutionary psychology (EP), and which is traceable to the automated true-only reactions of bacteria, which evolved and operates by the mechanism of inclusive fitness (IF). See the recent works of Trivers and others for a popular intro to IF or Bourke''s superb "Principles of Social Evolution" for a pro intro.Beginning with their innate automated responses to the world, animals extend their axiomatic understanding via deductions into further true only understandings ("theorems" as we might call them, but `theorem'' is a complex language game even in the context of mathematics). Tyrannosaurs and mesons become as unchallengeable as the existence of our two hands. This dramatically changes ones view of human nature. Theory of Mind (TOM) is not a theory at all but a group of true-only Understandings of Agency (UA a term I devised 10 years ago) which newborn animals (including flies and worms if UA is suitably defined) have and subsequently extend greatly (in higher eukaryotes). However as I note here W made it very clear that for much of intentionality there are System 1 and System 2 versions-the fast unconscious UA1 and the Slow conscious UA2 and of course these are multifaceted phenomena.Likewise the Theory of Evolution ceased to be a theory for any rational educated person before the end of the 19th century. One CANNOT help but incorporate T. rex and all that is relevant to it into our innate background via the inexorable workings of EP. The logical (psychological) necessity of this was laid out in great detail in "On Certainty". Incidentally, the equation of logic and our axiomatic psychology is essential to understanding W and human nature (as DMS, but afaik nobody else, points out).So, most of our shared public experience (culture) becomes a true-only extension of our axiomatic EP and cannot be found mistaken without threatening our sanity. That is, the consequences of an S1 `mistake'' are quite different from an S2 mistake. A corollary, nicely explained by DMS and elucidated in his own unique manner by Searle, is that the skeptical view of the world and other minds (and a mountain of other nonsense including the Blank Slate) cannot really get a foothold, as "reality" is the result of involuntary fast thinking axioms and not testable true or false propositions.I think it is clear that the innate true-only axioms W is occupied with throughout his work, and almost exclusively in OC (his last work), are equivalent to the fast thinking or System 1 that is at the center of current research (e.g., see Kahneman--"Thinking Fast and Slow", but he has no idea W laid out the framework some 75 years ago), which is involuntary and unconscious and which corresponds to the mental states of perception (including UA1) and memory and involuntary acts, as W notes in many examples. One might call these "intracerebral reflexes" (maybe 99% of all our cerebration if measured by energy use in the brain). Our slow or reflective, more or less "conscious" (beware another network of language games!) second-self brain activity corresponds to what W characterized as "dispositions" or "inclinations" (which refer to abilities or possible actions), are not mental states, and do not have any definite time of occurrence. But disposition words like "knowing", "understanding", "thinking", "believing" have at least two basic uses. One is a peculiar philosophical use, which refers to the true-only sentences resulting from direct perceptions and memory, i.e., our innate axiomatic System 1 psychology (`I know these are my hands''), and their normal use as dispositions, which can be acted out and which can become true or false (`I know my way home'').The investigation of involuntary fast thinking has revolutionized psychology, economics (e.g., Kahneman''s Nobel prize) and other disciplines under names like "cognitive illusions", "priming", "framing", "heuristics" and "biases". Of course these too are language games so there will be more and less useful ways to use these words, and studies and discussions will vary from "pure" System 1 to combinations of 1 and 2 (the norm as W made clear), but presumably not ever of slow System 2 dispositional thinking only, since any System 2 thought or intentional action cannot occur without involving much of the intricate network of "cognitive modules", "inference engines", "intracerebral reflexes", "automatisms", "cognitive axioms", "background" or "bedrock" (as W and later Searle call our EP).Another point made by W was that our conscious mental life is epiphenomenal in the sense that it does not describe nor determine how we act. It is an obvious corollary of his descriptive psychology that it is the unconscious automatisms of System 1 that dominate and describe behavior and that the later evolved conscious dispositions (thinking, remembering, loving, desiring, regretting etc.) are mere icing on the cake. This is most strikingly borne out by the latest experimental psychology, some of which is nicely summarized by Kahneman in the book cited (see e.g., the chapter `Two Selves'', but of course there is a huge volume of recent work). It is an easily defensible view that the core of the burgeoning literature on cognitive illusions, automatisms and higher order thought is compatible with and straightforwardly deducible from W.Among the leading exponents of W''s ideas on the language games of inner and outer (the `Two Selves'' operation of our personality or intentionality or EP etc. ) is the prolific Daniel Hutto (DH), who teaches at the same University as DMS. His approach is called `Radical Enactivism'' and is well explained in numerous recent books and papers. It is a development of or version of the Embodied Mind ideas now current and, cleansed of its jargon, it is a straightforward extension of W''s 2nd and 3rd period writings (though Hutto seems only intermittently aware of this). He is also author of the best deconstructions I know of Dennett''s preposterous claim to be following in W''s footsteps (in fact Dennett is just repeating most of the classic mistakes in grandiose fashion and hasn''t a clue about W) and of Fodor''s LOT and other nonsense. One ought to read Searle too, and the title of his review of Dennett''s book says it well "Consciousness Explained Away". Unlike most scholars, Hutto has put his papers (though often just proofs) free online at [...]Here, as throughout W''s works, understanding is bedeviled by possible alternative and consequently often infelicitous translations from mostly unedited and handwritten German notes, with "Satz" being incorrectly rendered as "proposition"(which is a testable or falsifiable statement) when referring to our nonfalsifiable psychological axioms, as opposed to the correct "sentence", which CAN be applied to our axiomatic true-only statements such as "these are my hands" or "Tyrannosaurs were large carnivorous dinosaurs that lived about 50 million years ago".Finally, let me suggest that with this perspective, W is not obscure, difficult or irrelevant but scintillating, profound and crystal clear, that he writes aphoristically and telegraphically because we think and behave that way, and that to miss him is to miss one of the greatest intellectual adventures possible.');

While this gives an interesting opportunity for the reader to read about the adventures of the Terran Marines on Halo that were not seen at all during a large stretch of the game, and a subplot about a Covenent Elite''s quest for honor and vengeance against our dear friend Master Chief, the book suffers somewhat compared to the other 2 in the series simply because of the timeframe it''s set in.Most people who read this book have already played through the single-player portion of Halo on the Xbox or PC, and having to read through a section that they''ve already experienced was slightly tedious for me.  Sections such as The Library, which was considered by many to be one of the more monotonous areas of the game, became almost a chore to read through; I slogged through it once, I don''t want to slog through it again in print!Still, the battle scenes are well written and showed a familiarity with the Halo universe; all the major characters such as the Master Chief, Cortana, and Captain Keyes are consistent with what we''ve come to expect from the game and Nylund''s novels in the series, and I was hard-pressed to find any technical discrepancies with the established canon.  The Terran Marine contingent''s fight for survival with the Covenent is also quite riveting, filling in some of the blanks that were left in the game.  Halo: The Flood is a wonderful way for people who may not be into gaming to continue with the sci-fi story that Bungie wrote for the game, and is a solid read for those who finished it.So, as a book on its own, Halo: The Flood gets 4 stars in my opinion.  If you''ve already completed the game, then I''ll downgrade my rating to 3.5 stars.  While the other two books in the Halo series are better, this is still a solid sci-fi read!');

(They are actually tainted artifacts; xenos in nature.) Their abuse has spread in the last two years. The root of its trade seems to be on Eustis Majoris, the capital-world of the Angelus sub-sector. Ravenor''s body is useless. It is a knotted, bulging sack of scar-tissue and old burn-smears. The limbs are but stumps. He maneuvers around with the aid of a force chair (a metal box) and verbally speaks with the equivalent of speakers. He is one of the Imperium''s best psykers. Each member of his small team wears a wraithbone pendant which allows Ravenor to "ware" (enter and take over) their bodies in an emergency.As this story begins, Ravenor and his team are at the world of Eustis Majoris. It is on this bloated sphere that they find a young boy named Zeal. They are not sure if Zeal is even a teenager yet, but his psyker powers are extremely interesting to Ravenor. So Zeal is basically adopted by the team. Once Ravenor''s investigation is over, he will turn his full attention to the boy. It is also on this planet that clues and possible allies will be found. These lead the team to Lucky Space, where pirates, death-worlds, and worse reside. But in Lucky Space, the team''s luck finally runs out.**** FOUR STARS! Many of these characters were introduced in the Eisenhorn Trilogy; however, if you have NOT read that trilogy you will have no real trouble what-so-ever. (I have yet to read the Eisenhorn Trilogy, so I speak from experience.) Eisenhorn is mentioned only in passing and the author does a wonderful job of keeping this story totally separate from the other trilogy.I found it a bit distracting when the story switches back and forth from First person (Ravenor''s view) to Third person. Fortunately, this does not happen too often ... usually when Ravenor is in someone else''s mind/body. A very good beginning to this trilogy. ****THORN WISHES TALON (Short story)This short story takes place as Ravenor''s team is heading back to Eustis Majoris. The tale not only bridges books one and two, but also gives readers a small glimpse into a possible dark daemon manifestation in the future. Eisenhorn fans will especially enjoy this short interlude.RAVENOR RETURNS (Book 2 of trilogy)The Divine Fratery is concerned with the manifestation of a daemon called Slyte, whose occurrence they had foreseen. Orfeo Culzean, one of their foremost expediters, is employed to make the manifestation happen. The manifestation is tied into the activities of Inquisitor Gideon Ravenor. Either Ravenor or someone close to him would trigger the event which would bring Slyte into being. Even though Ravenor had been warned (by Thorn), he must still do his duty. Thus Ravenor and his warband return to Eustis Majoris.Since their enemies believe they are dead, Ravenor and his team re-enter Eustis Majoris clandestinely. They plan to infiltrate the upper levels of the Administry on the capital-world and attempt to reveal how high the corruption reaches. The team now operates under the terms of Special Condition status: rogue, driven to independence by extremis, who will act with singular devotion, and recognize no law or master save the God-Emperor himself.**** FOUR STARS! This story holds many surprises. There is very little I can say without major spoilers. To give a small teaser, not all of Ravenor''s warband will survive this mission. The team will also expand in numbers. As with book one, there are still distracting jumps in First and Third person views. ****PLAYING PATIENCE (Short story)This short story reveals how Patience Kys was located by Ravenor and joined his warband.RAVENOR ROGUE (Book 3 of trilogy)Zugmunt Molotch is a genius. He is also psychotic. His ambition is to recover enough elements of Enuncia from xenoarchaeological sites in the outworlds to master a rudimentary command of it. Ravenor and his team have been after his for quite some time now. To continue their hunt, Ravenor''s group has gone rogue.The time span of the daemon manifestation prophecy has passed. Ravenor has no idea if it came true or not. The young boy, Zeal, has been in a catatonic state since he collapsed from a psychic assault at Miserimus. Ravenor''s blunter/untouchable, Frauka, sits by Zeal''s side waiting for the boy to waken. Should Zeal waken and show any signs of being the daemon''s host, Frauka is to immediately execute him.Since they are already rogue, Ravenor agrees to use a source his masters would have normally punished him for even considering. They travel to Utochre and locate the Wych House. With the help of one of the housekeepers, the group will travel several times via a portal (that resembles a door) in hopes of learning where Molotch is hiding. But will the team succeed in their quest? Is Zeal hosting the daemon, if the prophecy ever came to pass? And when it is all over, will Ravenor be able to make the ordos understand why he''s had to take the course he has?*** THREE STARS! Book three begins about six months after book two ends. The team''s numbers grow again, but as with the last book, not all will survive. I have to admit that I am a bit disappointed in this episode. Some questions were not answered. (And did I miss something or was the character of Alizebeth Bequin mentioned for only half a page in book one and then dropped?)All-in-all, I believe the entire omnibus deserves a rating of four full stars out of a possible five. The author swerves away from typical battles in order to give his readers some unique methods, twists, and a few surprises. Very well done. ***Reviewed by Detra Fitch of Huntress Reviews.');

Ravenor contains the same great characterization as his many other Warhammer 40k novels, as well as a solid amount of carnage.However, there are a few things I found to detract, unfortunately.  The narrative viewpoint switches back and forth from third person to first (Ravenor himself).  While not terrible, I think that a complete work in third person would have been acceptable.  Also, as a number of the main characters also appeared in the Eisenhorn trilogy, there are allusions to some of their pasts which were detailed in that series but which will be unfamiliar to readers of just this book.  There were a number of typos as well, not the usual case for Abnett''s works in my experience.Nevertheless, the story moves fast, with good action and progress.  The plot revolves around Ravenor and company attempting to locate the source of a chaos-inspired drug in use on Imperium worlds.  It leads them to lawless regions in which they are accosted by aliens, traitors, and renegades.  It was clear pretty early on that this was to be the first book in a series, as there were a number of loose ends left unaddressed.This was still a great book.  It was really enjoyable to read again of some of the compatriots of Eisenhorn.  There are some fond mentions of him from those who knew him, tying this new series to that one even more than the inclusion of returning characters.

Although interracial relations have improved by leaps and bounds and the President is black it will take hundreds of years to achieve harmony to the point where, for example, interracial marriage can be accepted as natural rather than an aberration. Although fiction, Ellison''s book can serve to put into historical context for the modern reader the great racial divide that existed not so long ago. It also explores the infighting and conflicting powerplays, jealousies and rivalries among the blacks. For many the road to power and success involved demeaning condescension to white authority which meant that that power or success could be rescinded if deference for and to the white man was deemed to be inadequate.The story follows an unnamed black man from his student days at a Negro College in the South to his working life in New York City and recruitment by the Brotherhood, a political organization run by whites purporting to befriend the black community and work for racial equality. We follow him on his quest to achieve respectable and successful personhood by accepting the dictates and discipline of leaders who use him as a means to achieve their own objectives with little or no regard for his rights, his intelligence or his feelings. His trust in other people goes unrewarded. As he is repeatedly deceived, he is often backed into corners where he is boxing unknown shadows as well as flesh-and-blood adversaries. He is frequently intellectually manipulated and swindled. I felt almost hypnotically compelled and emotionally committed to follow his struggles--which is something that distinguishes significant writing skill by an author. I admit that the character''s ubiquitous self-directed monologues and incoherent hallucinations can test a reader''s patience but when they occur they provide intervals for reflecting on the mental turmoil in the narrator''s life. At the end I regretted that in his journey he didn''t achieve one deep and meaningful relationship with another human being, although he came close with Carson, his compatriot in the Brotherhood, and with Mary, his landlady. He describes a lonely life of turmoil but he has an inner strength which supports him to pick up the pieces and move on. Staunch, but innocently naïve, determination characterizes his story.In the book''s Epilogue he attempts to sum up and make sense out of the chaos. As he leaves behind his previous high ideals, based on harmony, equality, discipline, trust and cooperation, he is left with a somewhat dissipated and divisive realization of life as he states: "I''m invisible, not blind. No, indeed, the world is just as concrete, ornery, vile and sublimely wonderful as before, only now I better understand my relation to it and it to me. I''ve come a long way from those days when, full of illusion, I lived a public life and attempted to function under the assumption that the world was solid and all the relationships therein. Now I know men are different and that all life is divided and that only in division is there true health." p 576');

In the previous volume, the Master Chief and Cortana manage to set the Pillar of Autumn to blow her engines after she is taken by the Covenant forces.  The explosion blew a sector out of the ringworld, knocking out most of the alien systems.  Meanwhile the Helljumpers capture the Covenant command ship, but it is already overrun with Flood carrier and combat forms, so the marines crash the ship into Halo and take out all onboard.In this novel, the Master Chief and Cortana are lurking in the vicinity of Halo in a Longsword attack craft.  They have repeatedly scanned the volume for other survivors, but none have been found.  However, they do discover an oversized Covenant ship coming out of slipspace.  Quickly powering down most systems to avoid detection, they discover that the Covenant flagship is using the same frequency bands as their equipment and Cortana manages to analyze the scattered returns sufficiently to register an object that they find to be a trio of cyropods.Using thrusters only, they maneuver the Longsword near the cyropods and the Master Chief goes EVA to bring them back inside.  Two Covenant cruisers enter the vicinity and start to move toward them.  However, a previously unnoticed Pelican drop ship hidden on an asteroid fires three missiles at the Covenanters and the cruisers turn to chase the Pelican.  The Master Chief hustles the pods onboard and Cortana seals the hatch and fires their engines.  As the Covenant ships lose the Pelican in the surrounding debris, the Master Chief takes the cruisers under fire and Cortana starts an evasion run.The Master Chief, Cortana and those on the Pelican are at large, but unable to escape, since neither craft has a Shaw-Fujikawa drive.  In fact, the only slipspace capable vessels in the system are Covenant.  The Master Chief starts making plans to take over the Covenant flagship.Meanwhile, in a flashback to the fall of Reach, it appears that the Covenant forces didn''t glass the whole planet with plasma fire.  The area occupied by the top secret ONI facility, Castlebase, was not hit from orbit, but Covenant ground forces were starting to dig their way into the underground facility.  Several SPARTAN survivors from the orbital generator facility battle rally nearby, infiltrate the enemy, hijack two Wraith tanks, destroy the digging equipment, and then slip inside the base through another entrance.In this story, the Master Chief and a few other survivors from Halo return to Reach in the captured Covenant flagship.  Cortana has gathered valuable information on Covenant weapons and slipspace technology.  Moreover, she has determined that the local Covenant forces are gathering ships to attack Earth in the very near future.  Somehow, they have to get all this critical data back to Earth as soon as possible.This story is typical of the series, in that a lot of 7.62mm ammo is expended to take out an unbelievable number of Covenant troops.  How they carry all that ammo and other munitions is a puzzler.  However, there is a semblance of a plot and a higher mission.  Best of all, some of the characters that were thought to be lost with the fall of Reach are now discovered to be alive and shooting, but the list of MIAs and KIAs is still long.The story also displays aspects of Covenant society that were not mentioned in the previous books and gives more hints about the forerunners.  However, this installment ends with humanity on the edge of destruction.  The last scene hints of at least one more volume.Highly recommended for Halo fans and for anyone else who enjoys nonstop firefights with a variety of horrifying and powerful opponents.');

While the Flood certainly wasn''t bad, combined with the fact that it was written by a different author with a plot that most of us knew, made it a little boring but nonetheless a more indepth version of Halo.However, Nylund is back and so is his brilliant style of writing and conveying scenes of non-stop acting in First Strike.Those who have loved the series so far will continue to be impressed with the newest novel until the one which will tell the story of Halo 2.First Strike of course picks up pretty much right where Halo (The Flood) leaves off with John and Cortana floating in space in the hope of finding survivors.They find survivors and embark on a quest to find Reach and possibly any Spartan''s left on it.Without spoiling the book too much, John will have some backup for the upcoming war with the Covenant.Overall, if you haven''t read this book you''re missing out on a great preview to Halo 2 and a great read for any science fiction fan as well.');

Instead he wakes up Katerina, Princess of a place called Taina that existed over 10 centuries ago. Unwittingly, Ivan has stepped into the Russian Sleeping Beauty and has found that it isn''t a fairy tale after all.  Enchantment tells of how Ivan, unsuited to the time and culture of Taina, knowing only the language from his studies in college, and Katerina, Princess of Taina, overcome Baba Yaga, the witch who wants to end the Taina way of life and rule the country.  On Ivan and Katerina''s side is knowledge and eventually love. The two travel to Ivan''s time to prepare for the upcoming battle with Baba Yaga. They have advanced weapons, loyal people, and Ivan''s mother, who is a witch herself.  But Baba Yaga has fear on her side; the power of a spellbound god; sorcery, hatred, trickery. She will give them no easy victory.  Enchantment is a captivating story; a fairy tale so original it can hardly be recognized as a retelling.

The characters were well developed, and did develop in the course of the story. The secondary characters actually had a pulse, and were not cardboard cutouts. And beneath this all was an affirmation of mutual respect across culture and time barriers; the sanctity of marriage in society; and the ultimate triumph of good.Mr. Card does a superb job of crafting characters that work within family organizations. As he pointed out in his introduction to "Speaker for the Dead," most characters in books are free-roaming adolescents that run around solving other peoples problems.

Sherlock Holmes is single, and Watson''s wife is a pale shadow of a person.One interesting plot point that Mr. Card does not develop is the importance of childbearing.

(They are actually tainted artifacts; xenos in nature.) Their abuse has spread in the last two years. The root of its trade seems to be on Eustis Majoris, the capital-world of the Angelus sub-sector. Ravenor''s body is useless. It is a knotted, bulging sack of scar-tissue and old burn-smears. The limbs are but stumps. He maneuvers around with the aid of a force chair (a metal box) and verbally speaks with the equivalent of speakers. He is one of the Imperium''s best psykers. Each member of his small team wears a wraithbone pendant which allows Ravenor to "ware" (enter and take over) their bodies in an emergency.As this story begins, Ravenor and his team are at the world of Eustis Majoris. It is on this bloated sphere that they find a young boy named Zeal. They are not sure if Zeal is even a teenager yet, but his psyker powers are extremely interesting to Ravenor. So Zeal is basically adopted by the team. Once Ravenor''s investigation is over, he will turn his full attention to the boy. It is also on this planet that clues and possible allies will be found. These lead the team to Lucky Space, where pirates, death-worlds, and worse reside. But in Lucky Space, the team''s luck finally runs out.**** FOUR STARS! Many of these characters were introduced in the Eisenhorn Trilogy; however, if you have NOT read that trilogy you will have no real trouble what-so-ever. (I have yet to read the Eisenhorn Trilogy, so I speak from experience.) Eisenhorn is mentioned only in passing and the author does a wonderful job of keeping this story totally separate from the other trilogy.I found it a bit distracting when the story switches back and forth from First person (Ravenor''s view) to Third person. Fortunately, this does not happen too often ... usually when Ravenor is in someone else''s mind/body. A very good beginning to this trilogy. ****THORN WISHES TALON (Short story)This short story takes place as Ravenor''s team is heading back to Eustis Majoris. The tale not only bridges books one and two, but also gives readers a small glimpse into a possible dark daemon manifestation in the future. Eisenhorn fans will especially enjoy this short interlude.RAVENOR RETURNS (Book 2 of trilogy)The Divine Fratery is concerned with the manifestation of a daemon called Slyte, whose occurrence they had foreseen. Orfeo Culzean, one of their foremost expediters, is employed to make the manifestation happen. The manifestation is tied into the activities of Inquisitor Gideon Ravenor. Either Ravenor or someone close to him would trigger the event which would bring Slyte into being. Even though Ravenor had been warned (by Thorn), he must still do his duty. Thus Ravenor and his warband return to Eustis Majoris.Since their enemies believe they are dead, Ravenor and his team re-enter Eustis Majoris clandestinely. They plan to infiltrate the upper levels of the Administry on the capital-world and attempt to reveal how high the corruption reaches. The team now operates under the terms of Special Condition status: rogue, driven to independence by extremis, who will act with singular devotion, and recognize no law or master save the God-Emperor himself.**** FOUR STARS! This story holds many surprises. There is very little I can say without major spoilers. To give a small teaser, not all of Ravenor''s warband will survive this mission. The team will also expand in numbers. As with book one, there are still distracting jumps in First and Third person views. ****PLAYING PATIENCE (Short story)This short story reveals how Patience Kys was located by Ravenor and joined his warband.RAVENOR ROGUE (Book 3 of trilogy)Zugmunt Molotch is a genius. He is also psychotic. His ambition is to recover enough elements of Enuncia from xenoarchaeological sites in the outworlds to master a rudimentary command of it. Ravenor and his team have been after his for quite some time now. To continue their hunt, Ravenor''s group has gone rogue.The time span of the daemon manifestation prophecy has passed. Ravenor has no idea if it came true or not. The young boy, Zeal, has been in a catatonic state since he collapsed from a psychic assault at Miserimus. Ravenor''s blunter/untouchable, Frauka, sits by Zeal''s side waiting for the boy to waken. Should Zeal waken and show any signs of being the daemon''s host, Frauka is to immediately execute him.Since they are already rogue, Ravenor agrees to use a source his masters would have normally punished him for even considering. They travel to Utochre and locate the Wych House. With the help of one of the housekeepers, the group will travel several times via a portal (that resembles a door) in hopes of learning where Molotch is hiding. But will the team succeed in their quest? Is Zeal hosting the daemon, if the prophecy ever came to pass? And when it is all over, will Ravenor be able to make the ordos understand why he''s had to take the course he has?*** THREE STARS! Book three begins about six months after book two ends. The team''s numbers grow again, but as with the last book, not all will survive. I have to admit that I am a bit disappointed in this episode. Some questions were not answered. (And did I miss something or was the character of Alizebeth Bequin mentioned for only half a page in book one and then dropped?)All-in-all, I believe the entire omnibus deserves a rating of four full stars out of a possible five. The author swerves away from typical battles in order to give his readers some unique methods, twists, and a few surprises. Very well done. ***Reviewed by Detra Fitch of Huntress Reviews.');

Ravenor contains the same great characterization as his many other Warhammer 40k novels, as well as a solid amount of carnage.However, there are a few things I found to detract, unfortunately.  The narrative viewpoint switches back and forth from third person to first (Ravenor himself).  While not terrible, I think that a complete work in third person would have been acceptable.  Also, as a number of the main characters also appeared in the Eisenhorn trilogy, there are allusions to some of their pasts which were detailed in that series but which will be unfamiliar to readers of just this book.  There were a number of typos as well, not the usual case for Abnett''s works in my experience.Nevertheless, the story moves fast, with good action and progress.  The plot revolves around Ravenor and company attempting to locate the source of a chaos-inspired drug in use on Imperium worlds.  It leads them to lawless regions in which they are accosted by aliens, traitors, and renegades.  It was clear pretty early on that this was to be the first book in a series, as there were a number of loose ends left unaddressed.This was still a great book.  It was really enjoyable to read again of some of the compatriots of Eisenhorn.  There are some fond mentions of him from those who knew him, tying this new series to that one even more than the inclusion of returning characters.

So when Alvin, the seventh son of a seventh son, shows the same ability to speak and wield the powers of the land like any Red (read: Natives), he is taken by Ta-Kumsaw, and woven into a story that threatens to be bigger than all of them - and likely a tale that will soak the ground with blood.This second book has a lot more characters to it, and the story expands from the scope of just Alvin''s point of view.  Be prepared to meet various historical figures in this tale, including Napolean and ''Ta-Kumsaw,'' and references to many more like Andrew Jackson and Ben Franklin.

There is a glimpse at the French Canadians in this alternate history, and the black heart of one William Henry Harrison, who in our world became president after his slaughter of the Indians at Tippecanoe. The novel''s main plotline then begins with Alvin''s setting out from Vigor Church to Hatrack River, the place of his tumultuous birth and where he now will become an apprentice smith. He is accompanied by his brother Measure and it isn''t long before they are captured by Choc-Taw hired by Harrison to smear the reputation of the Red prophet Tenskwa-Tawa (formerly Lolla-Wossiky) and his brother Ta-Kumsaw. Alvin and Measure survive their capture and are rescued by Ta-Kumsaw. Then, on the shores of Lake Mizogan, Alvin begins to learn of his destiny as a Maker and the incredible city which he must build.And this is only the beginning. RED PROPHET takes us over a wide array of places and shows us incredible characters and sweep of history. There is so much here that stays with the reader long after the novel ends, such as the anger of the townsmen at Tippecanoe, Alvin''s travels all over this wide land, Eight-Face Mound, and Becky''s mystical loom.

Alvin arrives in Hatrack River seeming like a normal 11 year-old boy, but you''d think his year-long adventure with Ta-Kumsaw in RED PROPHET, who took him from Lake Superior to Florida and everywhere in between, would have made more of a mark. And while the novel can be read speedily, it still seems too long and full of awkward meditations. The violent ending and unveiling of Peggy also seems unbelievable.Nonetheless, these form no reason for me to not recommend The Tales of Alvin Maker, I find this an immensely entertaining series and PRENTICE ALVIN has its place.');

Alvin''s apprenticeship is very interesting, but it is Peggy''s story I''m really starting to enjoy more. Peggy is a torch - someone with the knack to see futures in the heartfires of folk, and her own future is intertwined with Alvin''s. But when she sees that her own future is a loveless one if she waits for Alvin to arrive, she does the unthinkable - she runs away, to find a way to at least have love for Alvin, if not love from him. Her determination to thwart her own gifts of futuresight is a joy to read, and her strength of character - somewhat rare for female characters in a lot of fantasy works - is a nice change. Very enjoyable.So is where the tale ends, with a bit more magic than usual, and a set-up for the next story that I''m glad I didn''t have to wait years for - like all the other folk who''ve been reading this series since book one.''Nathan');

Each chapter contains an interesting development, and the book has several nice twists.The only note of caution I have is for the series in general.  Card has a way of turning his protagonists into supermen.  Think, for example, of Lanik Mueller in "Treason," Bean in "Ender''s Shadow" or Jane in "Children of the Mind."  I don''t know whether this is a way for him to wriggle out of plot problems or whether it''s his own predilections.

The first book introduced us not only to Alvin but also to his world, an alternate America where hexes work and everyone possesses a "knack," or paranormal ability.  In the second book, we''re told the story of the Prophet, a variation of Tecumseh''s brother, and his effort to form a Native American safe haven.  Here, Alvin apprentices as a blacksmith and his hopeful wife (introduced in the first book as a young girl when Alvin is born and fully aware of Alvin''s abilities) learns how to be a lady only to return disguised as a teacher.  When and where she "learns" Alvin is a maker and "decides" to teach him is surprisingly bypassed in the storyline.

I was (and am) fascinated with the Games Workshop''s numerous gaming products, so I thought I''d give it a try. I loved it at the time, and after many years, many re-readings, and hundreds of other novels, it remains one of my favorite speculative fiction novels ever.Many bizarre events occur in this novel, and it would be impossible to describe them all. It is set in the universe of Warhammer 40,000, probably the most successful science fiction wargame ever. It will particularly appeal to GW fans, but even those not familiar with the game should have no trouble reading it, as Ian Watson describes the setting in considerable detail.The protagonist, Jaq Draco, is an agent of the galaxy-spanning Human Imperium. It is his job to root out all who would oppose the Emperor, an unspeakably ancient and powerful being who is both head of the Imperial government and god of the Imperial religion. Draco is trained to be absolutely ruthless in the destruction of his enemies, even if he must kill millions or billions of innocent people to achieve his goals. His job, already enormously stressful, becomes even more difficult when he stumbles across the Hydra plot. This massive conspiracy has enormous plans for the human race-- but whose side are they really on? In order to answer this question, Draco and his several companions travel all over the galaxy, from a hideously mutated world at the heart of Chaos to the legendary, grossly-overpopulated homeworld of Ancient Terra.Along the way, Ian Watson manages to ask a surprising number of philosophical questions. In a time when humanity is surrounded by enemies and absolute evil is an everyday reality, is absolute tyranny justified? Can the zealous agent of such a tyranny rise above his station in life to become a true hero? In a society built upon intolerance and hate, is love even a possibility?Such questions are there for those who wish to consider them, but they are by no means the only aspect of the novel. The story is one of adventure on a massive scale, covering just about every aspect of speculative fiction. For science fiction fans, there are spaceships, alien beings, and truly fascinating worlds. For fantasy lovers, there are magical powers and arcane secrets galore. For horror buffs, there are bizarre cults, hideous demonic entities, and brutal witch hunts.This book works on every level. There are fascinating characters, terrific (and often terrifying) atmosphere, ethical conundra, and darn good adventure. Whether you''re looking for post-modern morale ambiguity or just an enormously entertaining read, you can''t go wrong with this one.NOTE:This is the first book in a trilogy, books 2 and 3 of which are "Harlequin" and "Chaos Child."

Their battle is greater than the usual God vs Satan struggle as denounced from New England pulpits.  Subtle, mysterious forces focus on the birth of a baby during a river in sudden flood. As the child matures it becomes apparent that he is the pawn of powers greater than even the preacher imagined. Al, Jr. becomes the fulcrum of of a metaphysical tug of war, soon realizing that he has been gifted (or cursed) with special powers as the seventh son of a seventh son.  But how will he use them, since Water seems to be his personal nemesis?  The boy is safe nowhere...  It''s not easy for readers to identify the forces of good and evil in this particular struggle for the boy''s soul. His world is layered with superstition, Indian folklore and the immortal forces who maniupulate humans casually in the pursuit of their diabolical agendas. The only thing constanst is that we desire Alvin Jr. to survive, but which side will ultimately claim him in the primordial spiritual battle?  Does he even have a choice?  Protected by his family, a traveling Taleswapper and an unknown girl who can "see" the future (or variants thereof), Alvin at 6 discovers that he has the Knack.

I think it a testament to Davies'' great storytelling ability that I could not put down any of the three books.  I suggest reading them in close succession because the second book (The Manticore) sheds a lot of light on the other two books.  It''s interesting that in this book (the 2nd), we get 250 pages or so written from the point of view of a minor character:  Boy Staunton''s son.  If you stop to think about it, the whole trilogy is structured around the question "Who killed Boy Staunton," so it shouldn''t be surprising to read an account by his drunken son, the famous lawyer of his counseling sessions in Zurich.  Rarely does one find such well-drawn characters these days in novels -- by the end, you''ll feel like you''ve known Paul Demster for years, along with the simian Liesl, level-headed Ramsey and of course Demster''s character, Eisengrim.This book is a bit "deeper" than the first two as we find ourselves transported to an almost magic-realism portrait of myth and fantastical events in the World of Wonders.  I actually enjoyed the first two books more although I still think this last book is a master work.

The majority of the novel is Mangus telling his life story. During this story, Mangus lives "four different lives"(Warlton 5) First he was born with the given name Paul Dempster, a Reverend''s. At the age of ten he ran away with the carnival and became Cass Fletcher and controlled a mechanical card-playing machine as a carnival act. Later he named himself Fastus LeGrand and worked as a stunt double in a travelling play. He finally became Mangus Eisengrim, a world famous illusionist. Countless times during his story he asks the question, "Who was I?"(61). At the beginning of Paul Dempster''s life there was no trouble with who he was. He was born prematurely and so, right from the start, he was a survivor. He also was a Reverend''s son, and his mother was known to others as a "hoor"(24). He knew exactly who he was, but anted to be someone else. After running away with the carnival, or as he said "The carnival ran away with me.", he recalls that he was "prepared to do anything rather than go home." At the carnival he became known as Cass Fletcher. This initial change in who he was was the first sign that there was a conflict with who he was. His time spent as Cass Fletcher, roughly eight years, was the most conflicting time of his life. In the carnival Cass operated a card-playing machine called "Abdullah"(49). He would sit inside the machine spy on his opponent''s cards and slip better ones into Abdullah''s hand. At point in his life Cass spent most of his time inside this contraption, perfecting his spying and card slipping and when he ate, and that was seldom, he would do it inside Abdullah as well. He was almost never seen or spoken too. This neglect and abuse led him to believe that he was nobody. He mentions "I was Nobody... I did not exist.". At this time his "search for self" came to the most obscure solution possible. He believed himself to be Nobody. However, when he was seen and acknowledged, it was mostly when he was on stage as "Abdullah, the undefeatable card-playing machine". This caused him to think that when he was not Nobody, he was Abdullah. His answer to "Who [am] I?" was either Abdullah, an inanimate object and a machine to trick an audience, or nobody at all. It wasn''t until he was about eighteen, when the carnival he was working for went out of business, that he escaped being trapped in Abdullah. He moved to France and became a street performer. His fake passport had "Fastus LeGrand" as his name. So finally he was no longer, and would never again be, Nobody. Early in Fastus LeGrand''s career as a street performer he was offered a job as an actor in a play called "Scaramouche"(162). He was hired as a stunt double for a man named Sir John. All Fastus had to do was walk a tightrope and juggle some plates, but he had quite a problem imitating Sir John. A fellow actor said that he couldn''t "get Sir John''s rhythm."(167). As he began to get the idea, he realized that he was again hiding from the audience as he had done with Abdullah.Was this to be another Abdullah? It was, but in a way I could not have foreseen. Experience never repeats itself in quite the same way. I was beginning another servitude, much more dangerous and potentially ruinous, but far removed from the squalor of my experience with [Abdullah]. I had entered upon a ling apprenticeship to an [egotism].Fastus had to become Sir John. Eventually he succeeded, so much so that he was later accused of eating Sir John. "You ate Sir John... You ate the poor old ham."(224). Another crisis in his identity. Fastus learned to walk, act, speak, move, stand and probably even blink exactly the same as Sir John himself. During Fastus''s time with the play he was known to most as Mungo Fetch. The name was decided on by other actors who thought it sounded appropriate for a man whose job it was to copy someone else. Fastus LeGrand, the only name he picked for himself, was thought to be far too noticeable, and a stunt double was to be kept secret. Again he needed to be hidden from the world. But when Sir John retired, Fastus was no longer Mungo Fetch, nor Sir John. He was beginning to win himself back. Once again, he was known only by a single name. But "Fastus LeGrand was still not who [he] truly was, or who he was meant to be."(Pierce 318) Soon after Fastus stopped acting in Scaramouche, he was hired to fix toys for an old rich man. It took months just to fix a single toy because of the minute tinkering took to perfect the movement. But there were hundreds of toys that needed to be fixed. So Fastus spent almost every waking hour of his time working on them. Thus, he had virtually no contact with the outside world. He was even given residence with his employer, so he didn''t even have to leave the old mans mansion. Now, instead of hiding behind Abdullah or Sir John, he was hiding behind his work. It was during his time fixing toys that Fastus changed once again. As he continued fixing toys for the old man, Fastus met the old mans niece, Lisel, whom he fell in love with. Since Fastus LeGrand was not his real name and he didn''t care for it much they decided to change it again. Fastus would by no means return to being Paul Dempster, and even less so did he want to go back to Cass Fletcher. So Lisel named him Mangus Eisengrim. Becoming Mangus was the "final conflict with who he was."(Pierce 553) Mangus was finally rid of his former lives and had come to the end of his search for self. He had answered the question "Who [am] I?". He lived life as Mangus and became a world famous illusionist and eventually returned to acting, since he had such a skill with imitating people. He was, from then on, Mangus Eisengrim.');

So, for  the last eight days, I have literally been living in his alternate America.  I was utterly captivated by the books: "Seventh Son," "Red  Prophet," "Prentice Alvin," "Alvin Journeyman,"  and now "Heartfire." I read them so quickly and so close together  that I can''t really review them as separate books; this is sort-of my  review of the whole series (up to this point).In this version of  America, there are three separate countries on the east coast (New England,  Appalachee, and the US), plus the Crown Colonies of the south that are  still tied to England. Almost everyone has some sort of supernatural  "knack." Alvin, the main character, is the seventh son of a  seventh son and the most powerful man anyone''s seen in a long time. He''s on  a quest to build Utopia -- the "Crystal City" -- but he doesn''t  know how he''s going to do that (and perhaps OSC doesn''t either). While the  first two books were mostly about the Red-White conflict, the next three  have been about the Black-White conflict -- specifically, abolitionists  against the supporters of slavery. The next book will probably involve the  Civil War, as Peggy (Alvin''s wife, a "torch" who can see possible  futures in people''s "heartfires") was unable to prevent it.Any  reader who hasn''t read the first four books will be hopelessly confused, so  don''t even bother -- go read the first four! In book five, while I liked  knowing what was going on and getting to know Calvin, Verily, and Peggy  better, I did miss some of the old friends (like Takum-Sa, Taleswapper, and  the Vigor Church folks). I can''t call into question the wisdom of plot  choice, as some other reviewers have, because I assume Card still has a  handle on where he''s going (we can only hope); although I wasn''t quite sure  why Alvin had to go to jail again. Perhaps a subtle reminder that people  don''t like what they can''t defeat. I found the Camelot storyline to be  quite interesting, and I thought that this book had the series'' best  dialogue. Toward the end, it seemed like Alvin was invincible; I''m glad for  Calvin''s spark of redemption (I hope it will stick), and I enjoyed the  scenes of Alvin''s triumph, but...I think he has enough disciples now.  Get us to the Crystal City, and do it soon!(As a sidenote, I think that  questioning Card''s intelligence because of his choice of religion is  uncalled-for.

The attention he puts in fake introductions or prefaces is such that, at a first reading, you don’t realise that they are the beginning of the novel.This is what happens in “Eaters of the Dead”, in which the author pretends he is translating the manuscript of the protagonist, Ibn Fadlan. His attempt is a complete success. The text seems really written by this historical figure, which probably never existed, both thanks to its style and the missing parts, which are explained as if indeed the book was the result of putting together real pieces of a manuscript. It is actually a work of fiction partly inspired by the story of Beowulf and partly by actual documents.Despite the deliberately dated style, the plot is compelling and opens a gap of knowledge on the civilisation of the Normans, seen from a more civilised Arabian from Baghdad. After the time necessary to adapt to this kind of narrative, I could see the scenes forming before my eyes, such was the interest aroused in me.The author also manages to insert something scientific within the story, which makes it even more fascinating: the encounter with a hominid (maybe) still existing at that time.The truncated final is genial and adds further credibility to Crichton’s deception; with this novel he shows once again, if proof were needed, that he is a great storyteller.The only downside to this book is that, having read it, it has further reduced the number of works that I still have to read by this author, who left us too soon.Rita Carla Francesca Monticelli, author of Red Desert - Point of No Return');

Sphere should definitely be a part of any Crichton fan''s library. Skip the movie, though. Here, the science is less "convincing" than in Jurrassic Park (which is mostly convincing, but stretched) and Prey (which is better writing and fun, but not convincing). But that doesn''t matter, because Crichton can write an adventure like few others (as long as character isn''t important--character''s here take backseat to concept and science). Pace, as always is good. More a rollicking adventure than "something to think about" (typical of later novels) and quite enjoyable on that level.

Open one of his books with the idea that you''ll just read a chapter or two before bedtime and you''ll suddenly be bleary-eyed at three in the morning.  And although this particular title, which is somewhat less well known than such Crichton novels as THE ANDROMEDA STRAIN and JURASSIC PARK, it still packs a bestseller wallop.The premise is classic Crichton.  In his younger days, psychologist Norman Johnson was approached by the United States government to write a report on the psychological impact of an encounter with extra-terrestrials--and now, on the basis of his rather flippant recommendations, he finds himself en route to a possible UFO crash sight on the floor of the Pacific ocean.  Once established with his colleges in an underwater habitat, the government team encounters a mysterious space craft that contains a still-more mysterious sphere, and those who come into contact with it undergo an unexpected change.The writing is crisp and clean, the hard science is handled quite skillfully, and Crichton plays out his story at a breathless pace: yes, a page-turner if ever there was one.  Still, it is worth noting that SPHERE displays Crichton''s weaknesses as clearly as it does his strengths.  Strictly speaking, Crichton hasn''t had an original concept in some thirty years, and just as he rehashed his screenplay for WESTWORLD into the novel JURASSIC PARK, so does he rehash THE ANDROMEDA STRAIN into SPHERE.  The novel also contains both the foundational sexism and ambiguous conclusion so typical of Crichton''s work.Ultimately, SPHERE is popcorn: we''ve all had it before and you can''t make a truly satisfying meal of it.  But it is tremendously enjoyable all the same, and where is SPHERE is concerned... well, you''ll eat every kernal in the bowl.GFT, Amazon Reviewer');

The movie was full of promise but ultimately disappointing, so I was pretty curious to see how good a read the actual novel was.  Sphere is my first Michael Crichton novel, and I have to say I was quite impressed with Crichton''s prowess.  There are some logical flaws and inconsistencies in the plot, but Crichton is an incredibly gifted storyteller; I eagerly breezed through this novel in short order.  While it is heavy on dialogue, the story touches on a number of aspects of the human personality while mixing in some profound if problematic science fiction in the process.  This is a fast-paced thriller that definitely registers impressively on the suspense meter, particularly during the climactic late chapters.  While the ending is something of a letdown, the story leading up to it is gripping and fascinating, and important clues and plot points are presented with much more subtlety and effectiveness than what you will find in the movie adaptation.The novel is built around an incredible discovery; in the middle of the South Pacific, lying all but buried on the bottom of the ocean, rests a spacecraft of unknown origin.  Psychologist Norman Johnson, the author of a secret government paper on Recommendations for the Human Contact Team to Interact with Unknown Life Forms (a less than serious paper he wrote primarily for the money) is called to the site, where he is informed that he will be part of a team of scientists sent to study the mysterious craft.  Alongside him are an irascible Navy project commander, a brilliant, young astrophysicist/planetary geologist, a complicated female zoologist/biochemist, and a noted mathematician/logician.  This unlikely team of deep ocean explorers soon find themselves in an artificial habitat resting alongside the location of the mysterious ship.  Their exploration of the site yields more questions than answers, as the ship turns out to be an American spaceship from the future.  The truly enigmatic discovery onboard, though, is a giant sphere of unknown composition.  As the story unfolds, the team of explorers finds themselves effectively stranded on the ocean floor for a period of some days, and strange and frightening things begin to happen after one scientist somehow enters the sphere.  The scientists find themselves in communication with a supposedly alien entity who calls himself Jerry; whoever and whatever Jerry is, he seems to have the power to manifest remarkable physical creations and changes in reality.  The habitat and the team inside it soon comes under attack by such dangerous creatures as giant squid and killer jellyfish, but the problems eventually internalize themselves inside the group dynamic, a group that is shrinking in size as time goes by.  The mysterious Sphere imparts an amazing power to those who enter it, a power that such individuals may not even be consciously aware of wielding.  Ultimately, the last remnants of the research team begin pointing fingers at one another and take steps to insure their own individual survival in the face of an unquantifiable threat, making this novel a gripping psychological thriller based in a fascinating science fiction environment.Once the team arrives in the underwater habitat, nonstop action ensues.  One emergency after another challenges the crew, and the group dynamic of the team ebbs and flows along with each jarring crisis.  Along the way, we see ever more clearly into the minds and ways of thinking of our main characters, and a significant amount of ideas are expressed concerning the human condition.  Crichton provides for no obligatory rest areas along the way, as he takes the reader for an incredible ride that had me turning pages hand over fist in anticipation of what was to come.  Some of the science is questionable, but Crichton surely makes it all sound more than plausible.  The only real problem with the novel is a logical breakdown of sorts in the concluding chapters.  Still, the desperate attempts of the remaining explorers to survive, when they cannot even trust one another, make for a riveting reading experience.  Sphere is by no means a perfect novel, but I found it captivating and basically addictive up until the somewhat disappointing ending.  The movie adaptation takes significant liberties with the original story, so I would urge you not to let the movie''s failings prevent you from immersing yourself in this eminently readable novel.');

The Rotten Report knows better - topical novels are less cutting-edge than cut-and-paste of existing news stories. The result is less realistic than apparently realistic, which is just realistic enough to convince readers that a slim understanding of aviation will back up the slim plot."Airframe" centers on a fictitious airliner - the Norton N-22, a marvel of efficiency and safety. Popular opinion shifts when an N-22 encounters severe turbulence - killing three and injuring scores more. The media - as opposed to their practice in more recent disasters - blame Norton rather than the airlines (remember the hype over low-cost outfits like "ValueJet" and bloated dinosaurs like Pan-Am and TWA, and remember all of those "US-scare" jokes?), turning Norton into a target for ambitious reporters, "bottom-feeding" lawyers and other unethical, uninformed and non-credentialed "experts". "Airframe" could have been a great novel with which to explore issues like products liability, airlines and the media, but Crichton proves as prone as his media villains to unconvincingly sexing up the story.  The N-22 becomes beset by every conceivable unethical character in America, sharing nothing more in common than greed and ignorance.  Norton''s Aero experts are his heroes, selflessly protecting aviation from the Knights of the Round Tort.Using a fictitious story that makes no secret of its sympathies, Crichton rails against the media''s uninformed depictions of the aviation industry, citing the history of the DC-10'' - which was temporarily grounded following a string of accidents and bad press in the 1970''s - as an example. Though DC-10s returned to fly, Crichton insists that McDonnell never sold another.  I lived near an airport until ''98 and routinely saw DC-10''s in flight until they were phased out recently - nearly two decades after their "grounding" and about the same time as its competitor, the L-1011, a plane the DC-10 outsold. I even flew a DC-10 on a major airline in 1994 - I can''t remember when I last flew an L-1011. (The DC-10 was more likely a victim - if at all - of airline deregulation, which created many airlines flying short routes with small planes like the 737, now one of commercial aviation''s most popular jets; Strangely Crichton never explains how maligned MacDonnell managed to weather the DC-10 crisis enough to continue selling other planes and even try their hand at the MD-11, a next-generation jumbo jet.)  Crichton sticks to his version of the DC-10 story so uncritically, it''s almost impossible to take at face value. "Airframe" begins with a quote by a veteran journalist who warns against giving respectability to the uninformed, which does less to make Crichton''s points than seize the moral high-ground of debate. Certainly "Airframe"''s details don''t betray any more knowledge of aviation than any other layman who subscribes to "Aviation Week".Like a poorly designed aircraft, "Airframe" never gets off the ground - Crichton quickly lets you know that he''s less interested in aviation than the media''s sway over America...on any subject. In fact, "Airframe" is so removed from actually flying planes, that it could have been written about anything - choose your widget, and you''ve got a book.  "Airframe" might as well have originated as a novel about mopeds or cars until TWA 800 or ValueJet made it a more marketable to add chapters and use find/replace to swap small, wheeled vehicles for jets. The heroes of "Airframe" - experts involved in designing and building airplanes - are almost as removed from flying as the villains. Though he pays lip-service to the wisdom of  pilots (check that other quote before the first page) Crichton either won''t or can''t make a pilot one of his main characters, and Crichton''s aero-engineers - N-22 partisans who know airplanes - are kept around only to add the veneer of scientific correctness to his screed against the uninformed media. This is not Craig Thomas'' "A Different War", where the hero redeems the suspected airliner by flying it. The flight in one simple chapter of that book is enough to banish any hint of mopeds. Crichton''s holds airliners in a perspective no different from that of the dim laymen he populates his books with - as vehicles.  Alas again that the plot heaps scorn on the media even though corporate espionage has more to do with Norton''s problems. Despite often using "corporate" as synonymous with "sinister", "Airframe" is at best a flaccid indictment against corporations, let alone the media.Knowing he lacks enough plot to remind readers (and perhaps himself) that "Airframe" is about something exotic and beyond his grasp, Crichton falls back on his usual suspects - corporate intrigue, as if he can keep things going with a dash of "Rising Sun" and "Disclosure". When the plucky heroine, a Norton exec, wants to clear the N-22, she''s saddled with an unwanted intern (and likely a corporate spy) named Bob Richman. As far as Crichton is concerned, Richman is dead-meat the minute he appears: if his blue-chip upbringing, top-flight education, and high-priced (and foreign! ) car aren''t enough warning, his youth makes Richman enemy number-one (not that he does anything apparently evil, but Crichton''s villains are seldom as evil as ambitioned, arrogant or just unlikable). At first, I expected a surprise - make a hero out of the sleazy ivy-leaguer and confound readers primed for the Richman''s fall. Instead, "Airframe" remains boldly unsurprising (the brat''s name is the perfect example - I guess "Richboy" would have been too obvious), and there isn''t a thrill to be had. Throw in a "twist" ending that''s blatantly lifted from a true incident that the media responsibly reported, and you''ve got a book that deserves to be grounded - for good. If you''ve got to read Crichton, read the first Jurassic, the Andromeda Strain or Sphere. If you''ve got to read about flying, pick up Coonts or Craig Thomas.');

I also find his indirectly expressed issues of more than passing significance.  In Jurassic Park the issue is the arrogance of science in its manipulation of nature and the tendency of Western science to eschew accountability for the spillover costs to society when things go wrong.  Airframe is another example of it.  Here the issue of the freedom of speech and the lack of accountability of the media, particularly television news, is explored.  In a society that has come to stress individual rights, little emphasis has been placed on individual responsibility.  In order to be a functional culture, there has to be a balance of both rights and responsibilities.  Airframe makes this abundantly clear.As so often with Crichton''s central characters, a uniquely placed individual must come to grips with the inherent difficulties of fighting an uphill battle against society''s inertia.  The heroine, Casey Singleton, is given the task of deciding how a disasterous air accident happened before a crucial business deal collapses and takes the company she works for and all of its employees down with it.  It is by no means clear what is taking place, and ultimately she must come to trust her own personal interpretation of events to bring things to a head.The detail is impressive.

Though it had been lost for years, a sort of artifact-hunting American company used technology to find the location. They immediately form a team to go and get it before the rival company finds the diamonds first. Why are these diamonds, that are supposed to be laced with impurities, so desirable? It turns out that these so-called ''blue diamonds'' is one of the key factors to the making of super fast- and expensive- computers. Whichever computer company gets these diamonds will have a monopoly on the market for about the next five years- which makes the buyers extra and specially intent ($$$$$$$$$$) to get ''em.But, the team has a bit of a problem.

Two rival teams are racing to be first on the site, where lies a fabulous treasure of boron diamonds that are going to change the world as we know it.  One team is made up of a greedy conglomerate (Germans and Japanese, wouldn''t you know); the other is headed by a brilliant but cold-blooded young scientist named Karen Ross who is accompanied by an eccentric adventurer, a primatologist named Peter Elliot, and Peter''s laboratory subject, a mountain gorilla named Amy.  Amy has been the cause of concern among animal rights activists who feel she is being mistreated (actually, many humans don''t have it as good as Amy), so Peter wants to get her out of the country and back to her natural habitat.  The race to get to the diamonds first involves encounters with rampaging hippos, a murderous tribe of cannibals, and sneaky doings by the rival team who briefly drug and kidnap Amy.

That''s about it.Before embarking on _The Crystal City_ I went back and reread the entire series, as it had been five years or so since I was through them last and I wanted to be sure everything was fresh.  I was, once more, delighted by the voice with its smooth use of early American colloquialism, impressed by the obvious knowledge of history and folklore that went into them, captivated by the engaging characters and astounded by the scope of the work.  "Boy," I thought, "This is one Great Series!"Then I came to the current volume.  And I was really disappointed.  It purely does not compare with its companions in any way.  The story was frankly boring and the Biblical allegory--which was very suave and subtle in the earlier works-- was just ham-handed.  I don''t object to Alvin''s spending the entire book leading a group of slaves to freedom, but it doesn''t make for very interesting action and the subplots weren''t developed enough to alleviate the tedium.  The language was mundane, without any of the personality I had come to expect.  The earlier books seemed to be told by a breathing human being;  TCC resembled a recitation by a history prof counting the days until retirement.  The characters were flat.  The characters we had seen before were not developed any further and the new characters were not developed at all.  In previous books even minor characters had personalities and stories, but only lip service was paid to that here:  note the stunning difference between _Heartfire''s_ Denmark and TCC''s Old Bart.  Historical characters were inserted to fill the formula, but not even Abe Lincoln really added anything.  And as for Papa Moose and Mama Squirrel, well, I read the reason for them in the Acknowledgements, but I personally think using those names was a REALLY BAD CHOICE.  Every reference to "moose and squirrel" catapaulted me into a realm that had nothing to do with Alvin Maker and Co.  I''m sure you know the one I mean.I don''t mind that TCC started about five years after _Heartfire_ and that Alvin was in a really different place than one might have expected.  I do mind that the story behind this wasn''t really told.  It''s as if Tolkein had finished FOTR with leaving Lorien, skipped TTT altogether and started ROTK with "Well, now that Saruman''s been vanquished..."  There was just a huge chunk missing, and I think that chunk would have been a great deal more interesting than the story Card chose to tell.  It almost seems to me that Card has written himself into a corner with this series;  his characters can no longer grow and change and have real human experiences because that might tarnish them.  Good and bad are established, but there are no longer any of the shades of grey that make people interesting.Though TCC ends with some events that foreshadow a possible cotinuation of this series, it also sums up enough -- with "curtain call" appearances by most major characters fromt he series -- that Card could stop here without much harm done.  Unless he makes some radical choices for this universe, I hope he does stop.  I really wouldn''t like to see this series devolve any further.  The spark is gone and laying this series to rest before it decays would be a mercy.');

It had been about five years, but without ever going back and jogging my memory I was able to pick up the narrative thread in the ongoing story.  Besides, I was encouraged by both the title and the cover art for this novel that Alvin was finally going to take that golden plough out of his poke and finally lay the ground for his city, and in that regard I am not disappointed.  However, this is still not the climax of the tale.Orson Scott Card''s Tales of Alvin Maker series is set in an alternative America where some people are born with knacks, a magical ability that is both a great gift and a deep burden.  Alvin, the seventh son of a seventh son, is a "maker," who can make things and fix things, using his doodlebug to get a sense of what needs to be done.  After the death of his newborn son, Alvin is persuaded by his wife, Peggy (a "torch," who can see the various paths into the future that a life might take), to go to Barcy (the New Orleans of this world), and so he travels down the Mizzizippy with young Arthur Stuart on a flatboat with Abe Lincoln and his friend Coz.This matters because while Alvin Maker has his dream of the Crystal City, Peggy is concerned with preventing the great war that she sees coming over the issues of slavery.  In this America the United States is put one of several "countries" competing for the North American continent.  The south consists of Crown Colonies, Spain controls Florida and Nueva Barcelona (Louisiana), and the French still have Canada.  Meanwhile, the descendants of the Aztecs are still performing human sacrifices in Mexica and Alvin''s friend, Tenskwa-Tawa, the Red Prophet, controls the lands to the west of the Mizzippy.  Beyond the Hio Territory where Alvin was born in Hatrack River, the Wobbish Territory where Vigor Church and Carthage City can be found, and even beyond the Noisy River Territory, Alvin needs to find a place for his Crystal City.  Because when he saves a single life in Barcy, the act changes everything and forces a series of issues.  The establishment of the Crystal City is obviously a major moment in the series, but clearly it is not the big payoff.As always, it is interesting to see Uncle Orson''s take on some of the figures of American''s history.  If he liked John Adams, he likes Abraham Lincoln any more.  However, Stephen Austin and Jim Bowie do not fare well, and Alvin has to worry about the latter almost as much as he does about his younger brother Calvin.  I know there are those who want to read these stories as a religious allegory, but I have enjoyed taking the narrative at face value and I remain ignorant enough of the major tenets of Mormon theology so that I do not see anything more here than the American ideal dressed up in alternative clothing.  However, I find it hard to believe that there is only one volume left in the series, because there seem to be too many threads left to weave together.');

This book takes place on the western frontier of America circa 1801.  In this parallel universe an alternate history has been written that is similar to our own but here common folk have magical powers that make life a little more interesting.  Alvin is the seventh son of a seventh son and this is powerful and special birthright in this universe.  This story is the first of five and much of it is exposition for the series.A couple of things make this world interesting and Card''s creativity shines through.  Individuals in this world have special powers that range in power and usefullness. Some people have the ability to make a spark and light fires, one person has the abiltiy to find the best point to dig a well.  Others have knacks for making protective hexes, or seeing your soul (called heartfire).  Of course Alvin is not your average kid and his powers exceed and surprise thorugout the story in various entertaining manners.  I really like the way Alvin is a character with exceptional morals dealing with various forces while trying to understand his adolescent view of the world.  This first book sets the stage for two excellent followups before Card looses some steam and goes awry.  The fourth book is average and the fifth book is downright bad.  The family interaction is precious and Card gets away from this later on.The religious aspect of this series is it''s biggest downfall and the books where religion is more prominent are the weekest of the series.  The Alvin Makers series is a loosely based on the Book of Mormon and Card tends to get a bit preachy at times (especially in the first book).  This takes the book down a star as Card''s dogma isnt necessary to the story or the actions of the characters.  There are also mixed and hypocritical religious views within the stories that are too complex to go into here and needless to say religious zealots, born-again Christians and Orthodox Jews might get offended.Bottom Line: This is good stuff if you can stomach the preaching and sentimental corniness.  Books 2 and 3 are the Jewel of the series but these aren''t really stand alone books.');

Jon, as his friends call him, is a doctor, but also a soldier. He is an intelligent man and full of resources, but not the classic perfect action man. He has faults, makes mistakes, but in the end he is also a bit lucky (as it always happens in novels).Even if this book wasn’t written only by Ludlum, who would be dead the year after its publication, his touch is evident. In fact, despite being a very long book, it reads just as quickly, almost creating dependency, and has the right balance between action and introspection of the characters.The theme, that of a pandemic caused voluntarily to obtain a financial return, makes you think. The scenario, although extreme, is however realistic and, precisely for this reason, gives the chills.The scientific part, although it is not overly developed (for the benefit of the reader, who should not put up with any info-dump), is credible.Among the characters I particularly liked Marty, a nerd with Asperger’s Syndrome. It was interesting to follow the fluctuation of his thoughts as the levels of the drugs changed in his body.On the other hand, this novel is not without downsides, starting with an excessive head hopping. It is not functional to the story, so it seems almost causal and sometimes it makes you lose empathy with the characters.The ending opens to a series of books that can be read separately with limited or no real subplot, which unfortunately sounds like a commercial operation. For this reason I do not think I’ll read more books in this series, because the next two, to which Ludlum participated (I cannot say to what extent) are posthumous, while all others are completely written by other authors.Despite the downsides, I really enjoyed reading this book, so I still decided to give it full marks.Rita Carla Francesca Monticelli, author of Kindred Intentions');

Lynds has crafted a suspenseful thriller with solid, though perhaps stereotypical characters, and a good story line, though the ending was not that strong.Our band here consists of Smith, a soldier-doctor-medical researcher, his CIA agent almost-sister-in-law, his best friend from high school-millionaire computer geek, and an aging British secret agent, living alone in the California mountains with only a trained mountain cat for company and protection. This is the first in the Covert-One series, as the government decides to formalize this group after their stunning success here.The protangonist, Smith, finds himself AWOL, on the run from Arab killers, set up by another high school friend, grieving over the murder of a fiancee and several colleagues, and seemingly on his own to contain the world''s worst outbreak of a deadly virus. Also, it seems that the evil plot has been hatched by a conspiracy of greedy businessmen, government and military officials, that goes all the way to the pinnacle of power. And that is only the first two chapters.Forunately, Smith manages to suppress his grieving, outrun the bad guys long enough to assemble his team in a armor plated Winnebago, and escape down a California logging trail. Here the team splits up with the commando and the geek heading east, hacking every computer on the trail of the criminals, while Smith heads to Iraq on the trail of the virus, where he meets up with Russell, the sister of his late fiancee.Ultimately, the team determines that a pharmaceutical firm has been spreading the virus for many years, simultaneously developing and stockpiling the vaccine, in order to prosper from the worldwide disaster they created. The science and technology descriptions are masterfully revealed, a true strength of both Ludlum and Lynds. Finally, this thing comes to a rather weak conclusion, with the perpetrators being revealed and caught in a formulaic fashion.');

Card has ruined this formerly interesting history of an alternate America and Mormon allegory. HEARTFIRE kills the series that came before it like CHILDREN OF THE MIND destroyed the Ender Quartet and EARTHBORN wiped out the Homecoming novels.At the end of ALVIN JOURNEYMAN, Alvin and Peg Guester were wed and travelled to the home of the Weavers in Appalachee. The beginning of HEARTFIRE sees them departed on separate journeys, Peg has gone to the Crown Colonies to find a way to stop the oncoming war over slavery, while Alvin is wandering around the Northeast and eventually finds himself on trial (again) for witchcraft in Puritan-controlled New England.There is so much wrong with this novel. The plot is sloppily resolved, and indeed it could be said that Peg''s half of the story isn''t resolved at all but simply abandoned. Card wraps up Alvin''s trial in a mere two pages as if he has grown tired of writing this installment. Calvin''s redemption seems like it never progressed past the draft stage. In order to hide his shabby plot and silly characterization, Card stoops to a prurient sex scene where Calvin forces himself on a resisting-but-willing dame like something out of a romance novel (of course, that''s what the awful cover art makes the book look like).Alvin Maker is now essentially omnipotent, communicating telepathically with Peg across huge distances and able to run the entire length of the East Coast in a single night (funny how Card constantly talks about how the greensong is too weak now, but has Alvin perform such deeds). This makes Alvin considerably less interesting as a protagonist, as there are no surprises or suspense. Gene Wolfe, in his Book of the New Sun cycle, was wise enough to end the series after the apotheosis of his hero Severian. Card, however, is going to drag us through two more volumes with this unbelievable character.Ironically, however, Alvin doesn''t figure very much in his own series anymore. Most of the novel relates the thoughts of Peg, Calvin, and Verily Cooper. Alvin is reduced to an "aw, shucks" country boy cameo. There''s absolutely *no* progress in this novel towards the building of the Crystal City.I used to recommend The Tales of Alvin Maker, its first two volumes were very entertaining, but after RED PROPHET it''s become worse with every volume. I daresay I''d now recommend avoiding this series.');

I agree with other reviewers that each book in the Alvin Maker series cannot stand alone and must be viewed as a 300-page chapter in a longer work.  The plot is also rather weak, about a man with all-encompassing magical powers trying to create a utopian city, but these books are not about the Crystal City, any more than LORD OF THE RINGS was about Frodo Baggins and his magic ring.  Like Tolkien, Card is using a simple journey plot to give his readers the opportunity to explore a strange new fictional universe.Unlike traditional fantasy, however, Card''s universe is an "alternate" America, circa 1800, similar to the real America except that frontier superstitions, Indian folklore, and African voodoo are all real.  Over the course of five books, Card has examined Midwest frontier life, the American Indian struggle, Puritan witch trials, Appalachian mountaineers, French outpost settlements, and opulent Southern slave plantations.  We have met numerous historical figures, some accurately depicted, others a mere caricature of their real selves.  We have debated religion, politics, and law.  It is clear Card is steering us towards a finale where all these subcultures learn to coexist in a true melting pot society.Like other readers, I too am ready for Card to begin to wrap up the story, but as long as he continues to create such a unique new landscape, and populate it with quirky, textured characters, I''ll keep reading.');

It''s good, all right -- but it''s not very tightly unified, the writing is sloppy in places, and it introduces a few things that seem to contradict the original series at certain points.What really makes this four-vignettes-plus-an-epilogue volume so engaging is that in it, Hari Seldon has clearly become a literary alter ego for Asimov himself. And Asimov was well aware as he wrote it that he hadn''t long to live.And _that_ suggests that in writing about Dors Venabili, Wanda Seldon, and psychohistory, Asimov was "really" _also_ writing about his wife Janet Jeppson Asimov, his daughter Robyn, and his own literary oeuvre. So completely aside from its value as an SF novel (or, really, a story collection), it''s also of great interest for the light it sheds on Asimov himself.Asimov is generally credited with three autobiographies: _In Memory Yet Green_, _In Joy Still Felt_, and _I. Asimov_ -- the last being my personal favorite because it''s the most introspective and revealing of Asimov''s character. (Excerpts from all three, plus some further surprising revelations that you''ve probably heard about by now, are included in Janet Jeppson Asimov''s _It''s Been a Good Life_.)But there''s a case to be made that he wrote a fourth volume of autobiography, and that this is it. At the very least, this work of ostensible fiction is almost as revealing of Asimov''s character and end-of-life concerns as any of his nonfictional autobiographies.For that alone, it will be of interest to every Asimov fan.

New York is still a crime infested, dangerous place before it was cleaned up during Rudy Giuliani''s reign. Terrorism plays a huge role in this story and in one ominous moment David drops a terrorist off the deck of the World Trade Center.One of my biggest problems with this story would have to be the way David is written. He is meant to be an 18 year old boy who has been abused by his father and isolated from life, spending his days reading books. After he learns that he can ''Jump'' he transforms into a Jason Bourne, Jack Bauer anti-terrorist type character while tricking the FBI and police along the way. I also found his character to be written more like a forty year old than a teenager; interested in finding a decent high tea and wearing linen suits. His girlfriend Millie was particularly annoying and although she is meant to be a collage student and only a few years older, she reads more like his mother than his lover, always quick with the voice of reason. I think the author although writing a Young Adult book had trouble finding the voice of a YA and both characters read older to me.I would give the first half of this book 5 stars and the second half 3 stars, having grown tierd of the Jason Bourne anti-terrorism trickery by the end. Still a fun, exciting read that I would recommend.');

It is light and yet absorbing, fast paced and yet it gets to the root of your emotions.We are introduced to the main character, Davy Rice, as a young boy, escaping an abusive father. This is where the story starts because it is also the first time he experiences a Jump. Not that he believes it at first but this young lad has the ability to teleport.OK, I know what you are thinking.  That this is a tired old theme, already used to death in Sci Fi. Well you are wrong. Steven Gould, has taken a refreshing look at this subject and deals with it in a realistic way. Davy, as a character, is very easy to understand and empathize with and for this reason we truly believe what is happening to him.Before he can safely live a life away from his Father, Davy must get some cash, establish an identity, rent an apartment and all the things which you and I take for granted. This is made fascinating because he is a minor and has that special skill that no one is aware of. To complicate his life, Davy starts to fall for an older woman. A college girl who Davy impresses with his knowledge of the city and obvious wealth. Add to this the fact that his long lost Mother reenters the picture and Davy has a pretty full life.This is just where the adventure begins. His mother becomes embroiled in a plane highjacking but Davy''s efforts to involve himself are threatened by a police officer who is curious about his wealthy life style and questionable ID. The pace moves up to a higher level as Davy falls into international intrigue and ruthless terrorism.This novel is a terrific first outing from Gould and I would recommend it to anyone who still has a little adventure left in their soul.');

Abandoned by his mother, Mary, when he was twelve, because David''s father, her husband, also battered her, David decides that he cannot take any more abuse. In a moment of great personal angst, he discovers that he can teleport himself to a safe place. So, begins a new life for David and a most excellent adventure for the reader.David, to his own amazement, can teleport, but there there is a method to the madness, which he soon discovers. His new ability, however, enables him to not have to return home. He, instead, starts a new life for himself, one which the reader will enjoy sharing, as his new found ability, which he calls "jumping", leads to many interesting situations. Some of the situations in which he gets involved turn him into an unusual sort of super hero. Inventive and absorbing, this is a very special coming of age story that will keep the reader turning the pages.The only problem with the book is that many of David''s initial problems, while on his own, arise out of his lack of a social security number. This is a highly unlikely case scenario, because David would have needed a social security number for some of the standardized tests a student is required to take, as the social security number would act as the student''s identification number. Moreover, his father would have needed David''s social security number in order to claim him as a deduction on his income tax return. This is, however, the only false note in this otherwise totally delightful tale of a young man with powers of teleportation and the ways in which he puts his ability to use.');

Although Scott Card uses the history of mid nineteenth century america as a backdrop for his characters, he transforms this society and the resulting history by introducing the notion that America is the battleground for a fundamental conflict between the forces of mankind that oppose entropy and those within our species that, for very selfish reasons, support entropy.  Scott Card leaves the question of whether the fundamental force is the devil or entropy unanswered through book IV but something devilish is definitely occurring in the world in which Alvin Journeyman find himself.  Ender is the saviour of mankind in Ender''s Game and his supporting cast helps him fight the alien invaders.  Here, Alvin is mankind''s saviour and he develops a supporting cast of his own to help him fight not only ''entropy'' by creating a society of makers, but entropy''s minions on earth, an equally interesting cast of characters that includes his own brother Calvin.  A great read with a myriad of great characters!');

ALVIN JOURNEYMAN, unfortunately, is one of those plots. In this fourth installment of Orson Scott Card''s alternate-history and Mormon allegory "The Tales of Alvin Maker", Alvin is put on trial for his life. We, the readers, spend half the book being dragged through courtroom melodrama with a protagonist the reader is having a hard time caring about anymore.At the end of PRENTICE ALVIN, Alvin finished his prentice stint with Makepeace Smith and had returned to his hometown of Vigor Church to teach Making. ALVIN JOURNEYMAN sees him return almost immediately to Hatrack River due to the slander of a young lady in love with him. Upon his arrival, however, he is arrested and put on trial for theft of the golden plow, and his young ward Arthur Stuart faces being taken back to slavery in Appalachee. Verily Cooper, a young English lawyer with a knack for binding things together, is brought to the United States by rumors of a Maker and defends Alvin. And while Alvin endures his hardships in Hatrack River, his malevolent brother Calvin heads for Europe to learn from Napoleon himself how to rule over others.Orson Scott Card wrote ALVIN JOURNEYMAN five years after the previous installment, and it is pretty evident that he has grown somewhat tired of the series and no longer sure of what direction it will take. Alvin teaches Making in Vigor Church, but how can you teach that, what exactly would you be teaching? Card can''t come up with an answer either and thus he abandons the topic as soon as this installment begins. There are several blatant errors with geography (a judge refers to "the state of Kennituck" when Card had already said that Kennituck was a county of Appalachee). After fleeing from Vigor Church and wandering for a bit, Alvin and Arthur Stuart''s return to Hatrack River seems forced. Why would Alvin return to a place where his enemies await him? A bit of the novel is dedicated to the comeback of White Murderer Harrison, but after he is elected, Card quickly dispatches him almost beneath the reader''s notice. The ending resolves nothing and is little more than a Taleswapper cameo.The novel is also frustrating because it accomplishes little for the series. We see no progress towards the building of the Crystal City, and the only indication of where the series is headed are the occasional foreboding references to how Alvin should not visit Carthage City lest he die,  just as the founder of Mormonism, Joseph Smith, met a violent end in Carthage, Illinois. However, in ALVIN JOURNEYMAN Orson Scott Card does start to go off track with the formerly solid Mormon allegory. The trial of Alvin is obviously symbolic of the trials of Joseph Smith, but while Alvin is acquitted, the young Joseph Smith was found guilty of moneydigging. ALVIN JOURNEYMAN leaves the reader drifting, totally ignorant of what is going to happen next or, indeed, what the point of the series is anymore.The first two volumes of The Tales of Alvin Maker were quite entertaining and the third volume, while it had its moments, was a disappointment. It is becoming increasingly difficult to recommend the series.');

Alvin is now an adult, free of his onerous apprenticeship, and returns home for the first time in years. There he becomes re-acquainted with his family, and attempts to teach Making, with mixed results. One result is a false accusation of sexual misconduct by a young lady infatuated with him. He flees to Hatrack, where he was born and apprenticed. There his bitter ending with the smith who trained him develops into a trial, not only for a specific charge of theft, but also of his character.  Alvin''s estranged brother and fellow maker, Calvin, has gone to Europe and studies how to control people from Napoleon, and inadvertently is the catalyst that sends the right attorney from England to Hatrack, where he can defend Alvin. Once again, the alternate history is fascinating. This time we not only see America (but not much more than we''ve seen before), but we see how England and France have fared in this world of small and large magicks. My only complaint: it felt like a middle book in a series, which it is. It seems less a complete story than a continuation. It introduces new characters that obviously have more to do (having a torch around helps the author give glimpses of the possible futures). I wouldn''t start anyone with this book. And I want to get more than just a hint as to how the Crystal City will be created. I want more in general.

They live in the 1800''s (well sort of, its an alternate reality) and unlike many modern-day novels, they don''t talk or act as if they grew up in the 1980''s. They seem genuine, or as genuine as they can be in a world where magic and coincidence are equally common parts of life.At this point in the series, Card allows himself to have a little more fun, as the action criss-crosses the Atlantic, and we get to meet hilariously distorted versions of Napolean, Marquis de LaFayette, Benjamin Harris, and Daniel Webster.  This book is much better than the low point of the series (RED PROPHET) because there is less hocus-pocus Indian magic and more character development.  But it is not as fresh or inventive as the original (SEVENTH SON) partly because Alvin''s naivete and innocence is much more believable in a ten-year old boy than a 25-year old adult.

INSERT INTO public."Reviews" (review_id, user_id, book_id, rating, review) VALUES (1278, 1175, 452, 4, 'This one was more disturbing than I initially thought it would be. I read Bacigalupi’s Ship Breaker duo and since that was fairly speculative I thought this one would follow suit. It was shockingly realistic though. From what I know of the Colorado River, it, and the states it supplies, are going to be in trouble in the near future. That, combined with the lack of futuristic technology in the book, make it seem very close to reality. This book is ultimately about water, and a future in which it has become dangerously scarce.Set in the near future, three different characters try to navigate a water-starved Southwestern United States. The survival of different cities depends on their political clout  and ability to claim senior water rights. Las Vegas is one of the big players, with Catherine Case and her goons destroying nearby competitors by undermining their water supply. Angel is one of those goons, and when someone in the area starts claiming they have traced down a game changing water allocation document, Case send him to investigate. Lucy is a future Pulitzer prize winning journalist who is willing to risk her life to uncover the shady dealings and murders behind the ongoing legal battle for control of the Colorado. It is her friend who initially claimed possession of what might be the most valuable document in America, but when he is found murdered, she has the story of a lifetime in her hands. Maria is a refugee from the now ruined state of Texas who lives hand to mouth, trying to stay out of the way of local gangs and save up enough to escape to one of the more hydrated states.I thought this book was going to read like a dystopian novel, but it actually had a lot of characteristics of a legal thriller. A lot of the action is around legal battles for water rights, since the United States has not quite dissolved and any state caught attacking another for water will face retaliation from the federal government. There are hidden dealings, gangs and murders, but it is not outright like it would be in a dystopia. The cities have to at least appear to be handling things legally and above board. The world is dystopian, but the plot is the type of action I would more expect to find in a John Grisham novel.Maria’s viewpoint was probably the one I enjoyed reading about the most. Angel and Lucy both live fairly privileged lives within the world of the novel. Angel is employed by one of the most powerful women in America and Lucy has enough money to buy herself water. Lucy is also not native to the area, so she has the ability to relocate elsewhere (state borders were quickly shut down once the drought hit. Too many people were flooding into the states that had steady water supplies). It is from Maria that we get a good sense of what a prolonged drought and interstate tensions would do to the most vulnerable parts of the population and how it would potentially affect politics and companies. In Maria’s world, refugees from stricken states like Texas are taken care of by large companies like Dasani and Camelpack, who provide emergency water and other supplies to citizens who have no place else to go. Criminals can be bribed to sneak people across state borders, but since they are heavily policed by troops and local militias, that is a very dangerous option. Tensions against refugees even from other cities whose water has run dry makes moving around tricky, but when the water is turned off, people don’t have much of a choice. Local gangs prey on the desperate and those who cannot afford to live in technology rich, Chinese built condos often have to go to great lengths to buy the barest necessities. Maria’s best friend is a prostitute and Maria herself sells water to Chinese workers on their lunch breaks, all the while paying protection money to several dangerous men.The plot is full of twists and turns as Angel and Lucy both try and find the truth behind the elusive document and the trail of bodies it seems to be leaving behind it. There are several torture scenes I found a bit intense, so while others on Goodreads have characterized this as a YA novel, I would probably recommend it more for adults. It would be a good thought-provoking read for older teens if they could stomach the violence, but I found it a bit of a hard read in places.Bacigalupi built an insanely convincing world very close to our own. The most futuristic technologies are ones that are able to recycle water more effectively, and some medicines that are a bit more advanced. Nothing that could not reasonably come into being in the next 50 years or so though. Fighting is done with guns and cell phones and computers still look much the way they do now. That is what makes this book so scary. It is only a small step away from the present. Control of waterways is only going to become more important as the population continues to grow and average global temperatures rise. It is completely conceivable that battles over water rights in already drought stricken states will become more tense and water prices become more interesting than oil. It would be a great book for a book club that wants to tie speculative fiction closely in with world events.This book was a quick read since I had trouble putting it down. Having a variety of characters occupying different layers of the social strata gives the reader a rounded view of the world the author has created, and fast paced action keeps you reading. This was definitely an attention-grabbing book by an author quickly making a big name for himself.');

With the notable exceptions of William Gibson''s "The Peripheral" and Peter Heller''s "The Dog Stars", it is the best near future dystopian speculative fiction novel by an American writer published in the 21st Century, set in a compellingly realistic future recognizable to the likes of John Steinbeck, Edward Abbey, David Foster Wallace, and Charles Bowden; a brilliantly conceived blend of crime noir fiction and post-cyberpunk science fiction. Bacigalupi takes us to a near future Southwest in which states fight each other for water, acting almost like independent nations, with California waiting to claim all of the Colorado River''s water, as Arizona and Nevada literally wage war to obtain enough water for their citizens. A near future Southwest where migrants from economically decaying and drought-ridden states such as Texas are treated as though they were illegal immigrants from Mexico, protected by a Federal law which severely restricts migration between states by American citizens. A near future Southwest with self-sustaining habitats, arcologies, many built with Chinese money, in which their affluent inhabitants dwell amidst verdant gardens and ample water, while the rest of the Southwest''s predominantly impoverished residents must fend for themselves.Mexican-born Angel Velasquez is a water knife, a mercenary who is a detective, assassin and spy, working for Las Vegas-based real estate tycoon Catherine Case, ensuring that her high class, quite lavish, arcological properties have sufficient water, even if it means stealing water from others. When we first meet Velasquez, he is overseeing the destruction of the sewage treatment plant of a rival real estate development, ensuring that development''s demise. When he hears of a potential game-changing water source in Phoenix, he teams up with Phoenix-based freelance journalist Lucy Monroe, a battle-scarred female version of Charles Bowden with no love for Las Vegas, and Maria Villarosa, a young refugee from Texas who survives by relying on her wits. But theirs is an uneasy, unstable alliance, brought on only by their need to survive, and one that may not survive in a global warming-afflicted near future where water is worth much more than its weight in gold.Bacigalupi writes almost like he is William Gibson channeling the spirit of Elmore Leonard. His prose sounds so Gibsonesque that the reader may be forgiven for thinking it was actually written by Gibson. In the opening paragraph of Chapter Nine, Bacigalupi describes Phoenix''s "dark zone" as "The city consuming itself, whittling away the fat of its more prosperous times." In a much later chapter, he describes Las Vegas water knife Angel Velasquez''s reaction to being touched by one of the other key protagonists as "....His body felt as if it had been run over by a train, leaving nothing but bruised and shredded meat." Where he differs from Gibson is in describing a high body count of victims, in a style reminiscent of Neal Stephenson''s "Reamde", giving readers graphic descriptions of dead and decaying corpses and of people being gunned down; the latest victims in the grim, bloody struggle for water. Regardless, Bacigalupi demonstrates again that he is a brilliant, quite gifted, storyteller and prose stylist, whose latest novel is worthy of comparison with Gibson and Stephenson''s best.To his ample credit, Bacigalupi acknowledges his enormous debts towards many unnamed science journalists, especially those reporting on environmental issues, in the Acknowledgements section at the end. Much more so than any recent mainstream literary fiction writer who has written a near future dystopian speculative fiction novel, Bacigalupi excels in his world building, in creating compellingly realistic settings, characters and plot. Where he may falter is not giving readers the kind of poetic, lyrical prose that many encountered for the very first time in the pages of his debut award-winning novel "The Windup Girl", but that is just minor criticism of what is otherwise an exceptional achievement in near future dystopian fiction. An exceptional achievement that should be recognized as one of the finest novels published this year.');

INSERT INTO public."Reviews" (review_id, user_id, book_id, rating, review) VALUES (1286, 639, 460, 5, 'Can religion be subject to scientific scrutiny? In this remarkable study, Dennett proposes that not only can religion studied be methodically, but that it should be. His suggestion will be stupefying to some, as he readily admits. Is your mind open to the notion that the vast repository of human values could be carefully examined? Then this book will provide many new paths for you to explore. He openly appeals to a wide audience, starting with his fellow countrymen. Dennett''s ability to present complex issues, including those of social importance, in a clear and almost intimate manner should grant this book the wide readership he seeks.The beginning chapter, "Opening Pandora''s Box", reminds us that what was long considered inexplicable or mysterious can be revealed. He anticipates the criticism that "spiritual" things or "faith" aren''t qualities that submit to analysis. The task, he acknowledges, is immense, but can be accomplished. Certain elements must be agreed upon, such as the definition of "religion". What we call religion, Dennett, contends, ought to exclude "spiritualism", fanatic devotion to secular items such as ethnic groups or idolizing sports figures. On the other hand religion is a dynamic and variable concept and tight demarcation is neither possible or desirable. Religion, then, is a social system incorporating supernatural agents that can reward or punish. Writers preceding him, such as Robert Atran, Pascal Boyer and Walter Burkert are acknowledged as good starting points. Dennett cites them often as contributors to his thinking. His distant, but highly influential, mentor is William James.Although Dennett''s atheism is well known, this book is anything but a call for the abolition of religion. Quite the reverse. He acknowledges the pervasive place of religion in human society. He asks how that came to be and thoroughly examines the various elements that comprise the makeup of a religion. Beginning with the concept of invisible "agency" as the explanation for unusual or unexpected phenomena, ideas about these agents became memes passed through and accepted by society. "Memes", a concept popularized by Richard Dawkins, are the mental equivalent of biological genes. Memes are ideas that replicate and expand through a population. In the case of religion, Dennett suggests, answers to the mysterious might be offered by society''s older and wiser members. When such elders died, their transformation into agents themselves. It was almost inevitable, then, that human-like deities arose to be consulted and advise society on courses of action and behaviour.Once established, and with such powerful agencies underlying them, religions mounted a defensive barrier against inquiry. This "wall" which ranges in firmness from mild disapproval to vigorous hostility, has prevented science from posing rational questions about religion''s tenets. Dennett counters that religion should not be excluded from the range of topics that can be investigated. Language research has demonstrated that something seemingly too amorphous to clarify meaningfully can reveal a wide spectrum of human endeavours. He sets out a number of areas to investigate, such as the distinction between belief in a god and the "belief in belief". The latter is part of the glue of social cohesion and common purpose. Can we learn how that works? Dennett''s earlier work on "intentional objects" is invoked to discuss how gods are perceived by believers. What will the deity do in a given circumstance? What must the believer do to condition response? These are all plausible questions for enquiry and Dennett seeks to have them pursued.His final chapter is an outline of research paths that could be followed to investigate religion. He proposes a theory, which all readers are asked to challenge. He presents many commonly-held practices that are taken for granted, asking for explanations of why they exist and reconsideration of their value or impact. Should children receive religious instruction before they understand the issues? Is it "mental child abuse?". Should the practice be banned or is there another option? For this and other questions, evidence must be compiled and presented, along with countervailing theories, if they can be formulated. The only thing unacceptable is finding the quest itself unacceptable. Religion, Dennett notes, is too important to be beyond inquiry.This book is rich with questions we should be asking ourselves, if we aren''t already. Review them in this excellent call for explanations for an overlooked subject. Dennett knows that enquiry alone will not destroy religion. If it should, then religion''s thrall on humanity was false to begin with. Dennett notes that if enquiry results in clarification and honesty, religion would emerge in a healthier condition. Whichever you wish or hope to achieve by investigating religion, it''s clear the task must be undertaken. There are endless opportunities for research careers in the topics he lists for further exploration. Read this and find out where you might help take up the challenge.

Aurora is a counterpoint to that, more of a cautionary tale. The very old idea of sending humans to another star on a generation ship is examined and found wanting, not for technical shortcomings (though those are evident) but for very human reasons. To reach the stars takes decades at best so the generation that left is not the generation that arrives, with all the generations between forced into a life they did not choose and cannot change. This is the theme of Aurora, a theme Robinson handles in his usual masterful style.Despite being mostly narrated by an artificial intelligence, this is a very human story, and it is most definitely a story, with the science taking a supporting role to the fiction. It is full of engaging, believable characters, people it is easy to care about, people worth rooting for when they get into trouble.The science behind the story is fascinating and well thought out, without becoming overwhelming. It is certainly a more conservative view of the power of technology than Robinson showed in the Mars Trilogy; some things are just hard to do and even the best of human ingenuity can''t always come to the rescue at the last minute. It is a more mature view of what we can (or should) do, a call for time to understand the consequences of what we propose to do before we jump in with both feet.Part of my fascination with this story is in the artificial intelligence narrator, a quantum computer that gradually becomes a major character in the story it is narrating. It never becomes human in any sense, but it does grow and develop into a narrator of considerable power. It is a mark of Robinson''s writing skill that having a machine narrating a human story works so well.Robinson is a master storyteller, and his mastery shines through this book as it did in the Mars Trilogy. Aurora is a less optimistic look at the future, and takes a longer view of where we are going and how we will get there, perhaps a more mature and realistic view.Read the Mars Trilogy, read Aurora - they balance each other nicely.

With no outside help, he uses instinct and his past military training to save himself and solve the murder.Aside from the author’s choppy sentence structure, repetitive use of certain adjectives, and paragraphs of needless description, which felt more like filler, I really, and I mean this sincerely, loved this book.

If I remember correctly, I read somewhere, that an editor had actually called this book a “literary nightmare”, or something to that effect. Not to defend or praise, but every author has a method to their madness—their own distinctive writing style—whatever you want to call it, and I believe all the “editing no-nos” are part of Mr. Child’s voice.

I might read another Reacher book if I find one at the library.My father was a police officer and once worked on a case where he found a phone number that was somehow relevant to the case. In our small town, and long ago, reverse look ups did not exist. Together, we poured through the phone book looking for a name to go with that number. It was one of only two cases I had the chance to work on with my father (the other involved wandering along a road and field looking for a gas can as evidence of arson).In boredom, after thirty or so minutes, I suggested we just call the number and offer a story to get the recipient''s name. Dad quickly stomped on that idea and asked pointed questions to be certain I hadn''t tried this on my own. I don''t know what crime had been committed nor how dad''s case turned out. But I learned that there was no need for haste and that anyone with recent crimes on his conscience would react badly to a coincidental phone call fishing for information.Minor spoiler for the first fifth of the book: In the book, Reacher, a suspect in a murder at the time, convinces the detective involved to call the number and trick the respondent to give his name and address. The detective had no motive to hurry or be unprofessional though I could have accepted it if Reacher had made the attempt once free.The story had some cool points but I couldn''t accept the plot after the phone thing.

This 6th book in the series is a collection of short stories where it looks like the author explored some additional ideas he had about the universe that he created.  Unfortunately, this book (and the earlier 5th book in this series) feels like the author is wrapping up some loose ends from the first four books in the series and has sort of "written himself into a corner". Personally, adding in an alternate ending to one of the short stories (as he did in this book) suggests to me that the author has lost his way, or doesn''t really have a vision for the future of the series. Too bad, as the earlier novels were terrific, original and engrossing in the ideas explored, with sympathetic characters and well worth the read for their originality and twists and turns in the plot.If you are just starting on this series, the first 4 books are really, really good and I would recommend them to you and highlight also that you dont need to "finish the series" by reading the last 2 books in the series (in other words, if he had stopped the series at the end of the 4th book, it would have been perhaps in retrospect the best ending for the series). I was somewhat disappointed in the 5th book but was willing to overlook it (based on the twists and turns in the earlier books, I naively thought that some of the content was needed in order to setup the reader for the next book in the series). However, The End Of All Things was a disappointment ... somewhat flippant, trying too hard to be humorous. I was expecting some captivating and original twists in what I assume is now the final book in this series.  From my perspective, there were several additional tracks that the author could have successfully explored in this universe (some ideas: setting the next story in different time periods such as very early Union or post-Union, perhaps creating a new set of old-human characters with different life experiences being upgraded to Union soldiers, the Earth soldiers being hired as mercenaries and finding themselves in opposition to the Union solders, etc), but for whatever reason we ended up with what looks like a dead end. There are examples of authors who put on hold a series for 10 years or more before returning ... they noted that they needed to refresh themselves and do others things before coming back ... and being vey successful.  I remain hopeful that the author will eventually return to this series with some fresh ideas but it really felt as if the author pushed himself to satisfy his publishers and not necessarily himself or his loyal readers.');

I''ve enjoyed this "Nicholas Flamel" series,and I''ll obviously buy the sixth and final book when it comes out, but this installment, the Warlock,was a complete bore.Although I just finished reading it yesterday morning, I''m already having trouble remembering anythingthat happened in it - that''s how forgettable it is. There are multiple storylines - one for Dee, Dareand Golden twin, Josh, one for the other twin (sophie) and her aunt and Perrennelle, one for Scathach and her friends lost somewhere in time, one for the Isle of Danu Talis storyline set in the extremely distant past, and then a few other miscellaneous stories involving Mars, Isis and Osris, and others.None of the storylines are interesting, that''s the first problem. The "thrill of the chase" element, present in the earlier books with Flamelle protecting the twins from Dee and miscellaneous demons, is gone in this book. A second problem is that the overarching storyline - this Danu Talis stuff with the Egyptian Gods and some big battle which had members from every ancient civilization present - is really convoluted and confusing. And finally, and sadly, this fifth book really seems like filler and a money-grab.In theory, if you need a fifth book in a six book series such as this one, the fifth book should be getting all the pieces in place for the hurly-burly action that should be happening in book six. I don''t really believe that this happens in the Warlock. The Warlock has a whole bunch of dithering about whether or not Dee and Dare and Josh et al should release some monsters onto San Francisco, has this fairly boggling and boring material about Danu Talis, and then at the very end, after he''s been unconscious the whole book, Scott decides to wake up Nicholas Flamelle.In my opinion, anything important that Scott needed to do in Book Five could have been done in an extra chapter or two in each of books four and six... and changing this into a five book series.If you''re hooked on the Nicholas Flamelle series, you''re obviously going to buy book five anyway, but in the end, this will surely be the weakest book of the series.');

Using well thought out and documented arguments, Crichton questions the present infatuation with the fear of global warming. As the thriller suggests, anyone with a view contrary to the media and environmental elite is instantly discredited. Using a radical environmental organization''s (one that really exists) plans to further their agenda allows the author to expound in laymen''s terms on the arguments for (very little reliable and reproducible evidence) global warming and those against it.Crichton also gives the reader a lesson on the pervasiveness of the media in our society and how it can drive opinion even when the evidence isn''t there. Dr. Crichton has written an engrossing thriller that can be enjoyed for the thrills alone, yet he''s also made an important argument about not blindly believing "everything" but instead, checking the evidence for oneself.No matter what side of the debate about the theory of "global warming" (remember, it is only a theory, it''s not a proven scientific fact) and climate change one is on, this book deserves a read.

Those who prefer one aspect or the other will probably find themselves flipping quickly through the pages that emphasize the other aspect.Popular opinions are almost always wrong. That''s the theme of this book. The point is made in the context of describing how global warming, as perceived by the public and media, is different from what scientists are describing. Dr. Crichton argues through his story that we can waste a lot of time and resources on popular delusions, and we need to get our facts right. His appendix I on the dangers of politicized science is something everyone should read. The eugenics example is a chilling one.The adventure story itself is a Frederick Forsyth/Clive Cussler-type thriller written from the perspective of a young lawyer who tags along with a James Bond-like character who single-handedly saves the day along with his trusty, almost silent, sidekick. They are about as good a source for scintillating conversation as the Lone Ranger and Tonto. Instead of greedy multinationals or rich megalomaniacs being at fault, this story looks at how lawyers and rabid environmentalists can get carried away.In typical Michael Crichton fashion, the story develops around little-known scientific facts about how humans can influence the environment. So if you wanted to know more about how giant ice bergs, tsunamis and flash floods can be created, this is your book. At the same time, there are nice subplots around how to track terrorists via the Internet and an obscure way to assassinate people.I found myself drawn to both the adventure story and the global warming information. It''s a nice combination for the reader who likes a little substance along with their thrillers. Even I, though, thought the global warming was overdone. The characters needed a lot of work to become interesting, rather than just being devices to drive the plot along.

Not this one.  I would expect in a book titled Conrad''s Time Machine that you would first, encounter the character, Conrad, from Frankowski''s Cross-Time Engineer series.  Nope.  Now apparently this novel does explain how the time machine that eventually sent Conrad back to Poland in the Middle Ages came into existence, but I don''t consider that sufficient reason to try to dupe readers into thinking this is part of the Conrad series.Second, the second part of the title is "Time Machine."  With that, you should expect to have a lot of time travel scenes and with a dinosaur depicted on the front cover, you would expect them to be of the usual sort, adventures in well-known historical periods.  Not so, while lots of characters in the novel apparently time-travel on a regular basis, you never see them doing so and when you do, it is done for utilitarian reasons and not for historical exploration or exploitation.  Only in the last 20 pages of the book is there is a visit to the historical past and only to an isolated island untouched by important contemporary history.

Basing his time-travel on the more recent scientific theory of "multiverses" (i.e. the existence of many universes simultaneously, each one representing a time in the past), Crichton explores the possibilities of using Quantum technology to effectively "fax" people to another time period, for all of its fascinating and disturbing implications.When a brilliant but extremely arrogant and dictatorial scientist-turned-CEO demonstrates his new "time machine" to an inquiring professor, accidentally stranding him in medieval France circa 1357, it''s up to a quickly put-together team of historians to rescue him. They''ll be racing against the clock, and fighting truly terrifying foes, in order to bring him---and themselves---back.In TIMELINE, Michael Crichton does what he does best: take a fascinating scientific premise that is teasingly possible and run with it. He explores it further using a team of well-developed characters for whom we grow to care and root. These characters, who often sport complex relationships with each other, invariably get trapped in their quest and must find a way out of it, while simultaneously solving the original puzzle that brought them together in the first place. It all may be rather formulaic at this point; however, there''s no denying that the Crichton formula is one that works, and consistently. From THE ANDROMEDA STRAIN (1969) to JURASSIC PARK (1991), he has the knack for bringing us into a well-realized, brave new world that is based upon complex scientific theory and make us not only understand what is going on, but fully believe that it''s happening. The main reason why his novels work so well is because, past all the post-graduate science, he never loses sight of the human stories, and they are the most compelling aspects.  Plus, unlike certain authors (John Grisham comes to mind here), he really knows how to end a story! Michael Crichton has been a gifted genre storyteller for over 35 years now, and TIMELINE follows very nicely in this fine tradition. And it has one killer ending!HIGHLY RECOMMENDED');

Ideology, values, religion, etc do set context, but the above frames what is possible and likely. The masses outside of that coalition are irrelevant other than if they revoltDictators have a very small key coalition (and the smaller and easily they are replaceable the better and cheaper for him to buy their support - i.e. bribe). Democracies have a large coalition (i.e. most of the population) so you stay in power by providing public goods people want as just too many to bribe.Basically, money can be spent on 3 groups - yourself, the population, your key supporters.You need to first spend just as much as necessary for the supporters to back you (but not too much on the others as limits how much you can skim).The general population becomes an afterthought and so high taxes are a given except to the point it impedes the overall ability of the economy to produce revenue to exploit or risks revolt.Basic rules to staying in power:-Loyalty and replicability of support is key and the less beholden you are to them, the better.-Pay them just enough to keep them loyal and keep the rest. Your advantage is you know where the cash is stashed. Mugabie, for example, knew to pay his military first.-Need to control the flow of revenue – the most effective cash flow takes from the poor and pays your coalition as much as necessary – which is a huge part of why foreign aid is both ineffective and damaging.Money taken from the coalition to give the poor actually risks losing your key support then threatening viability - don''t be too cheap to them. The populace has no power to help you.Other insight include:-Revolts are ultimately determined by the willingness of the military to fire on their own citizens. It is an unpleasant task, so the cash has to be flowing, and when it is not they stand down / switch teams - USSR vs Tiananmen square highlighted this.-Aid increases the willingness of the military to stand by a dictator (i.e. more likely to open fire).-State bankruptcy for dictators is not an economic crisis but a political one – they lose power to pay off their supporters as people remain loyal only as long as it more profitable both now and later to do so.Money should never be given to bail out dictators. Any aid should only ever be given AFTER a target is hit. As otherwise hitting a target (like handing over Bin Laden or alleviating hunger) means no more reason to keep being paid and or have no incentive to reform. Why make the poor better? that turns off future aid and was money not spend on the coalition /yourself.-Dying dictators are not able to continue to pay so often a time of turbulence. Also explains why many dictators die soon after losing power (if not murdered) .-Pragmatically the phrase “mortgaging our future” functionally means regretting it was not they who came up with a popular policy that kept the other side in power.-Rigged elections actually serve a purpose - it is a means to show coalition members that they can be thrown out if don''t toe the line.-General misery for the populace actually makes it more important to get on your good side to get benefits to not live that way - increases value of being on the take - allowing a disasters impact to be greater (to the general population, not the coalition) is actually advantageous - more aid, more dependency on the leader. For democracies the opposite - demonstrates your failure to provide the public the goods/ leadership they expect-When you are not dependent on an economic tax base but on resources like oil/diamonds or foreign aid, have very little reason to care about the general welfare. Clean drinking water and good roads matter less also when you don''t need an economy.-Low salaries of cops is not an accident, makes it necessary to demand brides/ exploit – they get the privilege to do so, but vulnerable to removal by corruption charges if misbehave.The book was very insightful for the above and other ways. An economic approach is always prudent to understand how things actually work rather than how we would like it to work - you can''t fix what you don''t understand.');

The topic is nanotechnology and the theme of the scientific experiment that escapes from the hands of those who executes it. This latter issue is certainly not something new, but the point of view from which Crichton decides to tell us the story is very special.Almost the entire novel (except, I believe, one scene), in fact, is told in first person by the husband of the scientist on duty, who for most of the book witnesses strange situations that he does not understand or interprets in the wrong way, thus keeping alive our curiosity, page after page, and by allowing us to find out the facts with him. An approach that helps a complete involvement in the reading.Yet unlike other novels I''ve read so far, I''ve "just" given 4 stars. The reason is perhaps personal: the topic of the swarm of nanoparticles has not impressed me at all. It does not mean that the author hasn''t managed it in the best way. Quite the contrary. The swarms, as he describes them, are really scary. But I found it a difficult topic to conceive, especially in respect of the final developments of story, but also the whole part, in which he explains a bit about the frontiers of nanotechnology (information based in part on actual studies confirmed by the bibliography and to which a lot of speculation and fantasy is added) has not won my full interest. Maybe it depends on the fact that nanotechnology, at least in the way it has been presented in this book, did not appear very appealing to me. What missed, in short, as far as I''m concerned, was that part of the fun in the books of Crichton that comes from learning something new, this is because I did not felt involved in the topic, therefore the book didn''t leave too much to me after reading it.He, however, remains for me a solid point of reference. I only regret that, once finished reading all of his books, there will not be others anymore.Rita Carla Francesca Monticelli, author of Red Desert - Point of No Return');

It all adds up to a fun novel. I don''t buy the technology, or rather the "ultimate extension" of the technology, (certainly nanotechnology is here to stay), and it''s another variation on Frankenstein, but getting past all that, it''s fun reading, clever at times, more character-driven than any other Crichton novel, and on the whole a buzz (pun intended). I can''t imagine anyone really coming away saying they were bored or uninterested. It''s just too easy to have fun with. So, if it''s formula, it''s a formula that works, from the man who invented the formula. And, it''s better to read a new -- and, as always, clever -- Crichton novel than to re-read an old favorite.

Expertly weaving his narrative, the author grips the reader with his tale of nanotechnology gone wrong. While the book is wholly plot driven, with little attention paid to any character development.  this lack does not unduly detract from the enjoyment of the book, as the plot is so gripping.The plot revolves around stay at home dad, Jack Forman, who was a  whistle-blower about some high-tech espionage going on in the company  for which he worked. Unfortunately, he revealed what he had discovered it to the wrong person  and, consequently, was fired for his pains. While at home, he notices that his wife, who is a mover and a shaker for a bio-tech firm, has been acting a little odd and suspects her of an illicit affair.When her company wants to hire him to check out some programming problems at  their Nevada facility, Jack jumps at the opportunity. He then discovers that the firm has engaged in an experiment that has gone out of control. A swarm of nanoparticles, designed as micro-robots and programmed to act as one mind, has escaped from the environs of the firm''s desert laboratory. Programmed to be predatory, the swarm is deadly and evolving into something even more sinister with every passing moment.Moreover, he notices that it isn''t only his wife that is acting a little odd. Others at the facility with the swarm problem are also acting a little strange. All is definitely not what it seems. The only question is whether Jack, with the help of the scientists at the facility, can take control of the swarm before the swarm overwhelms and controls them.This book keeps the reader riveted, despite the fairly predictable, formulaic plot. As do many of the author''s other books, it also presents some serious ethical and moral issues for consideration by the reader, and the author himself gives a fairly detailed, cautionary foreword on the dangers of nanotechnology.I unwittingly bought the abridged, rather than the unabridged, audio book version for a road trip but was not disappointed.

Nowadays, there is little threat of a violent death, instead there is the terrible certainty of approaching mortality as Yosarian approaches seventy years of age. In some ways, this book is about dying.  I think Heller was influenced by Mark Twain and Grouch Marx for his comedic style.  The acerbic comical aspects are up-to-date, and relevent to  professionals in the corporate and poitical realms, of all ages. The same hilarious wordings and characterizations of Milo and Wintergreen and the Chaplain are all here, striving in today''s world...Just trying to thrive, as well as survive.  Yosarian is, of course largely agnostic though not nihilistic, but pradoxically axiomatic; so consequently the book is largely about sex, death, money, power, corruption, yet a hope for justice and the punishment of the wickid ("Dirty Old Man Stuff" as one reviewer mistakenly puts it).  I loved "Catch 22" (and will re-read it), but I *fully* appreciate "Closing Time" (and have re-read it several times).  The symbolism and literary depth are really innovative.  For example, Yosarian''s son proposes that the New York Port Authority Bus Terminal is actually what Dante''s Inferno was supposed to represent, and it seems completely believable.

Plunging in to avert crushing boredom, I discovered what all readers before me have, the absolute brilliance of it.  CATCH-22 is one of the finest war novels I have read, surpassing even M*A*S*H* and THE SHORT-TIMERS in its audacious mix of humour, horror, and insanity.  I also was overwhelmed by the fact that this was Heller''s first novel.  When I completed it, I rushed to a second-hand bookstore to buy CLOSING TIME.  I had become such an instant fan of Heller''s work, that it never crossed my mind that some things are better left alone.Why, oh why, did Heller pen CLOSING TIME?  CATCH-22 did not need a continuation.  It was lightning in a bottle, a once-in-a-lifetime event that could never be repeated.  But Heller, late in his career, decided, for better or for worse, that Yossarian and Milo Minderbinder had lives worth examining yet again.The plot begins with Yossarian (whom I desperately wanted to meet after finishing CATCH-22) in a hospital, now older, still bitter, but unfortunately, not funny.  As the labyrinth storyline progresses, Yossarian bumps up against a plethora of eccentric characters, both old friends and new enemies.  There''s the Chaplain (who can produce heavy water from his bowels), a president addicted to videogames, a bizarre wedding coordinator with dreams of the ideal society wedding within a decrepit bus station, and Milo, the schemer extrordinaire, now trying to sell invisible bombers to clueless generals.  All this, plus a subplot in an underground playworld that may or may not be Hell.Why doesn''t this work?  Part of the problem, I believe, is that CATCH-22 had a genuinely insane setting in which to place its insane characters.  The comparison of war with mental imbalance may not be new, but CATCH-22 made it fresh and invigorating.  CLOSING TIME finds Heller without such a setting, frantically trying to create insanity where there was none before.  It''s not enough to simply show nutty people;  they need a context in which they can flourish.  CLOSING TIME doesn''t provide them with one.Is it fair to keep comparing CLOSING TIME to CATCH-22?  Probably not, but Heller invites the comparison.  Reading CLOSING TIME is akin to attending your high school reunion. You meet all the people you once knew and loved, but despite your being glad to see them, you leave in a sonewhat depressed state.  You''ve grown up, but they haven''t.

I graded the book down one star for  partial misrepresentation.So, forget Catch 22 when you read this book.  Otherwise, you''ll just get frustrated.  Although some of the broad themes  are the same, the connection is pretty small between the two books.  Yossarian and Milo are the main connections between the two stories, but  decades later.  Their characters remain familiar, though.What, then, is  the book about?  It''s primarily a complaint about modern society and its  lack of a moral center and purpose.  If you like outrageous humor put in  modern times, you have the potential for a lot of good laughs.  If you want  a tight, believeable plot, you''ve come to the wrong place.Humor is  always somewhat relative, and Heller''s humor in this book is an acquired  taste.  He does go on to get his points across.  Edit the humor down, and  it would have worked better.Still, I found the book to be an interesting  novel, and am glad I read it.  Just be sure you know what this book really  is before reading it.  Read it for what it is, or avoid it for what it is  not.Personally, I think Heller is very good at making fun of the  bureaucracy stall in this book.  That is what made me interested in reading  it, and rewarded me for my patience.');

At the centre of all is the issue of genetic engineering and what this could lead in the future, or even tomorrow. Around this theme a chorus of characters moves, each with their own story, a thin thread unites them, that of a science that can change the nature for its own use and consumption. Along with other technologies that actually exist, Crichton puts others that might exist soon, or maybe are already being used without our knowledge. The boundary between the two is so difficult to discern that when you read of speaking orang-utans or of turtles with advertising logos you have the doubt that is really happening, you wonder what all of this is really achievable with current biotechnology.If you are looking for a reading of pure entertainment, this is not the book for you. Nor it is if you are looking for great characters in which you can identify."Next" must be read to speculate on the future of science, and legislation related to it, to learn new things and imagine very possible scenarios. You close it, at the end, with the satisfaction of being enriched and at the same time with a sense of unease, which arises from the fear that what you read can become real and you could not do anything to prevent it.Rita Carla Francesca Monticelli, author of Red Desert - Point of No Return');

Ever since the ANDROMEDA STRAIN, this is the writer that rides not just the zeitgeist wave but the very edge of biomedical breakthroughs - and makes great novels on the issues they raise. The SPHERE, CONGO, JURASSIC PARK are all excellent biothrillers. In NEXT he seems to have managed the first but neglected the later.This is collection of loosely related stories, all linked in some way or the other to either transgenic organisms or gene patenting; and all dosed under the light of the human science...being, well, all too human. Family obligations, personal choices, ambition, shortsightedness and pure greed bear much more influence on the outcome of the scientific process than most scientists will ever admit. I should know, I am a NeuroBiologist myself...I found NEXT to be quite interesting, and eagerly followed some of the story-lines in the early morning hours. Yet, at the same time, there was no backbone to the story other than the cautionary message. This made the novel, at first to give the feeling of never-actually-taking-off, only to finally turn into an informative episodic collection of characters I hardly cared for.This is, at most, a 3.5 stars novel. I rounded it up (rather than down) because of the great books Crichton has given us in the past. My advise to Michael Crichton would be "no writer is big enough to totally ignore his editors".');

A true Pandora''s box in that our scientific curiosity can sometimes get the better of us, the more we learn how to tinker with the very building blocks of life, the more temptations we face to play God. And as Crichton correctly demonstrates in his multi-layered novel, these temptations will not be meted out in some easily digestible fashion, they will come screaming at us in ever increasing numbers until our ability to distinguish the good from the bad is overwhelmed. And just like those multitude of spirits Pandora set free, there will be no going back into the box- discoveries might be lost, but they aren''t unmade, particularly ones of this significance and magnitude.The upside in Next: the end to most diseases and genetic defects is finally within sight. The downside: with all the money involved, there comes a loss of individual privacy and even certain freedoms.Crichton''s first question: are these remarkable discoveries truly worth the price? Crichton''s next two questions: will we ever really know the answer to the first question, and will it come too late?One misstep on Crichton''s part: the abrupt switches between story lines- he makes readers work harder than they should have to in order to follow along. But given the timeliness and importance of the story, it''s worth the extra effort even though the problem could have been mitigated by some restructuring.Nonetheless, as thrilling as anything he''s ever written- made even more dramatic by the potential for some of it to come true, and sooner rather than later- Next is a worthy read.-Mark Wakely, author of An Audience for Einstein');

Mars is no longer attractive to settlers - why live under a dome and spend years terraforming, when new worlds beckon where humans can live above ground immediately?  Belters are fearful that they and the stations they live on will also be irrelevant and being unused to gravity, relocating to new worlds isn''t practical.  Mars, Earth and the OPA are all competing to control the colonization. The OPA has gained legitimacy in the eyes of Mars and Earth for the first time ever, under Fred Johnson''s leadership, however radical factions are gaining traction and exercising their power through  terrorist actions.The book starts off slowly as Alex, Naomi, and Amos disperse for a variety of personal reasons  while their ship is in drydock getting repairs. Naomi''s reasons for leaving are the most mysterious and she won''t tell Jim.  While its an opportunity to fill in backstories of their characters it also veers into soap opera territory at times.  Holden, without his crew and "family" for the first time in years, tries to busy himself looking into the mysterious disappearance of ships entering the Ring.The various threads of each of their narratives ultimately converge as they try to thwart a terrorist attack by a renegade OPA cell that could threaten the very existence of Earth itself.The plot does pick up and moves quickly.  A plus is that Bobbie the Martian Marine is back and has a substantial role  A minus is that Clarrissa Mao who had previously tried to assassinate Holden also is back but I had trouble buying into her character transformation.My deepest disappointment is that I keep hoping we''ll get back to the Aliens who created the Protomolecule and the Ring - who were they and why did their civilization disappear?However, entertaining enough that I will read Book 6.');

Of course, not all is what it seems.This novel moved at a slower pace than the other two books.  It tries to explore the religious or philosophical impact of the Ring on humankind, as well as what the Ring is all about.  Unfortunately, we get stuck with a rather silly revenge plot against Holden.

The book overall is fine, but not as good as the first two books in the series, which were page turners. In this instance, I was captivated by the works of the protomolecule and the strange space station. However, I was not particularly taken with several items:1) The plot where Holden''s broadcasting is hijacked and the younger Mao is running around causing destruction without anybody finding out. I cannot believe that Holden could be taken that easily for a ride or that someone as young as Clarissa, no matter the connections she may once have had, could pull off the hijacking of the Roci''s system. I know this is fiction, scifi at that, but to pull of what Clarissa did a team of CSI characters would be needed.2) The Martian Navy, allegedly the most powerful navy in the Solar System, being little more than faceless goons or storm trooper clones. That was not the case in the previous book, they had more depth.3) I feel as if in the effort to please a possible PC readership Anna was shoehorned in (an eastern European lesbian minister with an adopted child, ticks all the boxes to such an extent that all those attributes in one person are less believeable than aliens planting the protomolecule 2 billion years ago). Anna is simply all the characteristics of PC embodied into one person. This is a shame, because until this shoehorned character I could feel the reality of strong female characters, such as a very human (and flawed) Avasarala in the previous book or socialite Tilly in this book.Nonetheless, I very much enjoyed any chapters covering the OPA and its characters.

He has been shot, blown up, cut, stabbed, beaten numerous times, trapped in a silo with a raging fuel/air deflagration (leaving him with the worst injury we have ever seen on him) and yet he walks on.He is nearly immune to heat and cold, wearing no hat or gloves and presumably wearing the same English low cut gentleman''s shoes. He is never sick, not even with the digestive problems anyone has who travels and drinks water from a new locale. He has not seen a dentist or a doctor since leaving the army, has no physical fitness routine, eats starch and drinks nearly nothing but coffee and yet he is in perfect health, with nearly perfect teeth and somehow magically maintaining a massive musculature, which he uses to easily overpower any man, goodness, any six men, that fate tosses at him.

Sabriel and Lirael are both interesting, likable, strong-willed young women who rise to the challenges before them and come out on top. There are a few non-human characters I couldn''t forget as well, such as Mogget the cat and The Disreputable Dog, whose dialogue made me laugh out loud more than once.I''m happy to see that these books are now available as a reasonably priced boxed set.

INSERT INTO public."Reviews" (review_id, user_id, book_id, rating, review) VALUES (1519, 519, 808, 5, 'Garth Nix delves into the dark heart of high fantasy in the Abhorsen Trilogy, three interconnected fantasies about a family of necromancers who lay the dead -- and forces of evil -- to rest. Humour, detailed writing and deep characters, along with a richly-realize world, make this a classic-in-the-making."Sabriel" is the story of a teenage girl living happily at a girl''s school, while her necromancer father (the Abhorsen) roams around putting the dead to rest. All that changes when a sending brings her father''s sword and bells, meaning that he is dead or incapacitated. So Sabriel takes on her father''s duties, accompanied by a Free Magic cat and a mysterious young prince, and battles the specter of a horrible evil creature that is reaching out from death to snare her."Lirael" takes us to the cold citadel of the Clayr, a race of seers. Young Lirael is depressed because she doesn''t have the gift of Sight yet, even though everybody else her age does. But things take a sinister turn when she sets a horrifying, bloodthirsty creature loose, and must work -- with the help of the mysterious Disreputable Dog -- to get rid of it. But what Lirael doesn''t know is that the outside world is in danger too, from a sinister new enemy."Abhorsen" brings the series to an explosive conclusion. Lirael and her nephew Sameth -- along with "cat" Mogget and the Disreputable Dog -- are in danger from the Dead. What''s more, the Destroyer Orannis has escaped from his prison and is being assisted by an evil necromancer and the Dead called Chlorr -- and an unfortunate pal of Sameth''s. Now Lirael must call on her destiny as the future Abhorsen, and kill the Destroyer.Garth Nix had only written a couple of books, one of which was an "X-Files" novelization, when the first Abhorsen book burst onto the fantasy scene. Now he''s one of the most respected, prolific and well-liked fantasy writers in years, with his single books in print and two hit series for younger readers. But despite his newer works, his tales of the Old Kingdom are still his best.The Abhorsen Trilogy is a perfect example of dark fantasy, with its grotesque dead zombies that occasionally lurch out to attack the heroes, magical bells, and shadowy beasties that can (sometimes) be restrained. It takes the trappings of high fantasy and lets us see them through a mirror darkly. Not to mention the brilliant concept of the Abhorsen necromancers, who have power over dead and/or magical creatures, and bind them with Charter marks and bells.Virtually all of Nix''s characters are likable -- especially the gutsy Sabriel and nervous teenage Sameth -- and the acid-tongued animals and black humor add a wry spin to the fantastical stories. It takes a bit longer to warm up to Lirael, since she spends several chapters in the same-named book feeling sorry for herself, but once she gets moving she''s unstoppable -- and very likable.Garth Nix gave high fantasy a dark twist in the Abhorsen Trilogy. Full of magic, darkness, death and beauty, this is a classic in the making.');

INSERT INTO public."Reviews" (review_id, user_id, book_id, rating, review) VALUES (1527, 1359, 506, 5, 'If any twentieth-century American writer deserves a revival, it''s Ray Bradbury, king of the dime novels and refiner --- if not the inventor --- of mainstream science fiction. Unlike contemporaries H.P. Lovecraft and Philip K. Dick and disciples like William Gibson and Stephen King (who has greedily borrowed Bradbury''s otherworldly horror + local color equation), Bradbury isn''t very widely read by people beyond their teenage years. His novels THE MARTIAN CHRONICLES and FAHRENHEIT 451 are mainstays of junior and senior high school reading lists across the country, and therefore have acquired the stigma of youth-oriented fiction (which seems ironic now that so many adults are giddy like schoolchildren over Harry Potter). As if out of spite for being force-fed his work so early, many people seem to ignore Bradbury as they grow older, consigning him to the world of adolescence.All of which is unfortunate, for Bradbury stands as a singular chronicler of the second half of the twentieth century, peeking into our dark corners to see what scares us. BRADBURY STORIES: 100 of His Most Celebrated Tales presents these demons anew, collecting pieces from every stage of his long career, from his dime novel beginnings to his work in Hollywood to his recent resurgence with original books like LET''S ALL KILL CONSTANCE and ONE MORE FOR THE ROAD. For those who haven''t read Bradbury since high school, this collection serves as a fitting introduction to the surprisingly wide range of styles and subjects he has addressed; for longtime fans it is a reminder of the author''s ability to evoke "the monsters and angels of my imagination" through dreamy prose and unforgettable imagery.As well as any other American writer of the last century --- and certainly better than any other "genre" writer --- Bradbury creates a particular mood and setting in his stories that is best described as eerily autumnal. In THE OCTOBER COUNTRY, arguably his best collection, he describes this setting as "that country where it is always turning late in the year, that country whose people are always autumn people, thinking autumn thoughts." In the cycle of seasons, fall is the season of death --- falling leaves, browning grass, chilling winds, early darkness --- before rebirth, and in Bradbury''s stories death always lingers nearby, tracking and chasing characters and greeting them in unsuspected places.Whether or not they conjure the supernatural, the stories in this large collection show that this narrative texture, this October country setting, transcends that one collection and informs almost everything Bradbury wrote.Furthermore, the October country Bradbury evokes is a flip-side America, one where the American dream has been subsumed by collective nightmares. If nothing else, BRADBURY STORIES demonstrates the writer''s talent for heatedly and unpretentiously addressing social and political ills through his imaginative stories."And the Rock Cried Out," for example, follows two wealthy travelers in Africa who discover they''re the last white people on earth. Their punishment for the West''s constant imperialism is the loss of all worldly possessions and a life devoted to menial labor.In "The Garbage Collector," a man learns that if a bomb hits the city, he will have to collect the dead in his truck. The title character must decide whether to quit his job and assuage his conscience or keep working to support his family. To Bradbury''s credit, it''s difficult to tell which crime is more outrageous --- the civic government viewing its citizenry as refuse or making its employees compromise their morals for family.Any collection of this size is necessarily defined by what it omits as much as by what it includes. BRADBURY STORIES contains so many wonders, but where are "The Scythe," "The Crowd," and "Homecoming" from THE OCTOBER COUNTRY? What happened to "The Picasso Summer" and (a personal favorite) "Some Live Like Lazarus"?Such glaring oversights are certainly not the fault of Bradbury, unless you count prolificacy and quality among the most grievous of literary sins. Nor are they the fault of the editors and compilers, who doubtlessly had to make many painful cuts. Instead, they serve as a cry for another volume, perhaps entitled 100 MORE BRADBURY STORIES. It is maybe only a slight exaggeration to say that he could fill 100 such volumes with highly inventive and deeply felt tales.  --- Reviewed by Stephen M. Deusner from Bookreporter.com');

Among his expedition resides the best each medium has to offer. Things are slowly changing. The pace of change quickens after Fulgrim takes a silver blade from his crushed enemies. With the touch of the hilt, Fulgrim begins to hear a voice, calling itself the Spirit of Perfection, within his head.The Apothecary Fabius sways Fulgrim into allowing him permission to conduct experiments toward perfection. Fabius seeks to enhance the gene-seed of the Astartes. Many Astartes, such as Lord Commander Eidolon, Captain Marius Vairosean, and Captain Lucius, submit themselves to receive augmentative surgery. (This cannot be good.)Once Fulgrim joins the Warmaster''s treasonous plans, Fulgrim tries to coax Primarch Ferrus Manus to their cause. When Fulgrim fails battle lines are drawn. Fulgrim and Ferrus Manus stand on opposing sides. Only one can be allowed to live.**** Author Graham McNeill simply skims over the battle on Isstvan III. After all, it has been told twice already from two different point-of-views. The previous stories focused on battles on planets or ship corridors. First these were against the Emperor''s enemies. However, this one focuses on the corruption of art and the secret desires of Battle Brothers. No fights between reanimated Astartes this time. No, the dark forces of Chaos bring the blood and gore to the opera house this time. This, for me, is the best part of the book. McNeill brings the nightmare to vivid life before continuing the blood bath elsewhere. The book starts out slowly, but the pace picks up quickly. By the ending readers will find themselves holding their breaths and sitting on the edge of their seats. A great addition to the saga! ****Reviewed by Detra Fitch of Huntress Reviews.');

Then along came a South African dude with a dazzling smile, deep dimples and a strong comedic back ground along with natural intelligence.  So I have continued watching The Daily Show without really knowing too much about Trevor Noah but liking what I saw and heard.  Then he wrote a book.  It''s autobiographical but not an autobiography.He writes about his upbringing in South Africa.  He explains that he has a black mother and a white father, hence the name of the book "Born a Crime."  We hear how he moved from various sections of the city where he was not supposed to live.  In South Africa, it''s not a question of black or white people.  There people are known as Black, Coloured and White and must live according to their skin tone.  Since Trevor is very light skinned but not white enough for South Africa, he technically couldn''t live with his mother in the black neighbourhood.  But his mother did not believe she should have to live in the Black "hood", so she secretly lived in the white area.  You''ll have to read the book to see how she pulled it off.  He takes us through his school days and his unruly early life.  He explains how he changed from committing petty crimes to becoming a DJ and later a comedian.  But the book comes to a sudden end when he tells us about a terribly tragedy which befell him in his early twenties.Unfortunately he stops there and we don''t get to find out how he arrived in the U.S.A.  If he immigrated to America or got his television job and is there on a work visa.  If the States will be his permanent home or he intends to get back to South Africa in the future.  We also don''t learn anything about his personal life or how he enjoys his Daily show venture.  Maybe he plans to write another book down the road.  If so, I''d buy it.');

This first chapter gives us the set up, the hook, and everything we need to know to keep reading: After a night of drinking he can no longer remember, Ignatius (Iggy) Perrish awakens to find he has grown horns. These are not metaphorical horns. These are bony growths extending from his temples and forming curved points.Along with the horns, Iggy has gained powers of dubious value, including the ability to induce those around him to give voice--and in some cases action--to their darkest thoughts and desires. By touching them, Iggy can also see what dark deeds they have already committed.We quickly learn that, even before the appearance of the horns, Iggy was not an average guy. Not only is he a member of a marginally famous family, he remains the prime suspect in the year old rape and murder of his girlfriend, Merrin. It is this crime that Iggy sets out to solve and avenge using his newfound abilities.With Horns, Hill has crafted a genuinely original novel. How he came up with the idea would make for an interesting interview or essay. I can only imagine his agent''s reaction when the pitch was made, most likely a mix of "What the hell?" and "Oh, god, yes!"Hills'' prose, overall, is serviceable. There are few truly remarkable turns of phrase and, at times, he is given to recycling metaphors and overusing particular words. The eyes of snakes, for instance, are compared--no fewer than three times, meaning every time--to golden foil. Hill has also, for some reason, fallen in love with the word "bowels," which pops up, in a variety of contexts, at least a half-dozen times but probably more.One gets the sense that, stylistically, Hill hasn''t yet hit his stride, that he still has some growing to do. This is not necessarily a criticism since, though his prose feels a little unpolished, he is an undeniably good writer and can only get better. More importantly, if Horns is any measure of Hill''s creativity, than one can only wonder at what he might come up with next. He is, without question, one of the more interesting and promising new voices in horror literature today.And yes, Joe Hill is the son of Stephen King.');

Insignificant though it may seem, West & West are really forcing upon the reader an interpretation that is not required by Plato''s Greek; their translation of these passages has the practical effect of entirely begging the question of what it is that Socrates has in mind when he speaks of virtue in the _Apology_.  Presumably, they assume that it is sufficiently clear that Socrates has in mind specifically *practical* wisdom in these passages.  The Greek word, however, does not particularly connote prudence except in Aristotle, who obviously uses it as a technical term.  It is worth noting that at Apology 25c, 28d, and 29e "to give thought to" is the rendering West & West give to "phrontizein".  What would otherwise be an obvious connection is obscured by their translation of these two crucial words in Plato''s text.  To maintain consistency and to avoid begging important questions, West & West could perhaps have translated "phronimos" as "thoughtful" instead of "prudent".  At least "thoughtful" in English has enough ambiguity to leave open the question of what Socrates is exhorting when he exhorts everyone to be as "phronimos" as possible (29e and 36c; compare 30b, 31b, 39d, 41e).  This, I take it, is the paramount interpretative problem facing readers of Plato''s _Apology_, whatever translation they use.This flaw in West & West''s translation shouldn''t keep English readers from using their translation, since the alternatives offer even greater impediments to interpreting Plato.');

It''s about a major turning point in the Horus Heresy and the residual effects it had on minor players on Terra, particularly an Astropath(think extremely long-range telepath) named Kai Zulane.  Kai''s a survivor of a disaster onboard a starship that left him and only one other survivor, and his value as an Astropath has been called into question by those around him.  After Kai becomes privy to a secret that could affect the Imperium as a whole, he becomes the most wanted and important man on a planet filled with major VIPs.Graham McNeill really hits this one out of the ballpark.  After producing some great novels in the Horus Heresy series (A Thousand Sons, Mechanicum, Fulgrim, False Gods) he creates some captivating and tragic characters, Kai''s struggles, to overcome his guilt and deal with the incredible secret he could lose his life over, are a unique change from the trials of the various Primarchs and their soldiers in a galaxy where betrayal has shaken the loyalties and beliefs of what they believe and hold dear.The Outcast Dead will not be everyone''s cup of tea, if you were looking for a complete withdrawal from the Astartes Legions, there are some here.  But, they are pivotal in not only Kai''s journey, but in the works of a minor warlord ruling over a city of religious devotees, whose subplot will lead to great things from McNeill in the future.Give it a shot, if you are looking for more pieces to the larger picture of the Horus Heresy, you won''t be let down.');

The Raven Guard has escaped from the trap on Isstvan V, but the Legion is all but wiped out. Corax returns to Terra to seek the aid of his father - the Emperor of Mankind. The Emperor grants Corax knowledge of the Labyrinth. Situated in the middle of the deadly maze and sealed within an inner vault are the secrets to the Primarch Project. Lord Corax would be able to rebuild the Raven Guard. What would normally take a generation could be accomplished in months. Corax is determined that the Raven Guard will rise from the grave of defeat, take the battle to his treacherous brother primarchs, and bring victory to the Emperor. But unknown to Lord Corax, the mysterious Alpha Legion has managed to infiltrate the Raven Guard survivors.**** FOUR STARS! Author Gav Thorpe enters the Horus Heresy and leaves his mark upon the series. I do not recall another time (in this series) where a primarch had an audience with the Emperor. Thorpe handles the larger-than-life scene with ease. Brilliantly accomplished. Not only do readers follow Lord Corax and his Raven Guard, but they also get some insight from Horus''s side. Seems the Warmaster cannot even fully trust his own anti-Emperor brothers.Quite a bit of time is given from Lord Omegon''s point-of-view also. Unknown to Horus and the others, Omegon has an alien, a representative from the Cabal. And Alpharius, his twin brother, does not believe he or his Alpha Legion to be indispensable in Horus''s endeavors so he keeps secrets as well.In my opinion, Gav Thorpe has done the series proud. Main characters'' backgrounds are well developed. The maze is brutal and very deadly even for the Legioness Astartes. Conflict and betrayal are everywhere. It all adds up to make this story one exhilarating ride. ****Reviewed by Detra Fitch of Huntress Reviews.');

Hardy sees these as being transient and subject to great change even within a society. The novel is replete with references to differences in religious creed and how these foster intolerance - between high and low Anglicanism and with both to Roman Catholicism. The novel shows great  families falling into obscurity and other families assuming great histories to which they are not entitled. The conventions that enable these are not eternal. They are not inevitable. They have a beginning and they have an end. And yet, as Hardy shows, they claim the power to regulate the lives of human beings even to the point of condemnation. Tess is condemned  by a double standard that excuses the more powerful elements of a society. It is these social conventions  that Hardy identifies as transient and not eternal. he doubts their legitimacy. That is the main theme of the novel.');

And since Newton seemed to imply that Dan Abnett was one of the best writers they had, I asked him to send me what he considered to be the author''s best novels. One was an omnibus comprised of three books, and I was reticent to start something that big for fear of losing interest. The other was the opening chapter in The Horus Heresy sequence, Horus Rising. I''ve been told that this is probably one of the best and most entertaining sequences of books in the entire Warhammer 40,000 universe. The premise, that of a galactic civil war threatening to bring about the extinction of mankind, piqued my interest.Here''s the blurb:It is the 31st millennium. The forces of humanity have reached the stars. Under the benevolent leadership of the Immortal Emperor and his superhuman sons, the primarchs, the Imperium of Man has stretched out across the galaxy. It is a golden age of discovery and conquest. But now, on the eve of victory, the Emperor leaves the front lines, entrusting the great crusade to his favourite son, Horus. Promoted to Warmaster, can the idealistic Horus carry the Emperor''s grand plan? Worse still, this promotion has sown discontent amongst his brothers. How long before this escalates into all-out mutiny? Horus Rising is the first chapter in the epic tale of the Horus Heresy, a galactic civil war that threatened to bring about the extinction of humanity.I''m not sure if it''s the case with any other Black Library series, but what makes The Horus Heresy so accessible is the fact that it takes place about 10,000 years prior to most Warhammer 40,000 work. While I''m persuaded that being a newbie means that I likely missed a few nuances and foreshadowing, it by no means influenced my reading experience in any way. Hence, if like me you have always been curious about the Warhammer 40,000 universe but didn''t have a clue where the hell to begin, or could not make heads or tails of the continuity, then Horus Rising is the perfect starting point for you. The Horus Heresy recounts a tale of epic proportions which will have grave repercussions in the future of the Warhammer 40,000 universe, yet you can read it as a stand-alone series without a glitch. At least thus far. . .My biggest fear when I began reading Horus Rising was that it would be a seemingly endless sequence of genetically enhanced warriors blowing stuff up. After all, the story begins with a little summary telling readers that the vast armies of the Emperor of Earth have conquered the galaxy during the Great Crusade. Myriad alien races have been smashed by the Emperor''s elite soldiers and wiped from the face of history, as the Great Crusade seeks to reunite the disparate stands of mankind under the rule of the Emperor. Understandably, given the tone of this series, yes there are battle scenes and plenty of action. And yet, Dan Abnett imbues this violent tale with much more depth than meets the eye. Beyond the blood and the gore, the author explores a number of themes, chief among them loyalty, duty, brotherhood, faith, and even philosophy.It''s difficult to assess the quality of the worldbuilding based on Horus Rising alone, as I have no prior knowledge of the universe and this novel drops us in the middle of a pivotal moment that will rock the foundations of the Great Crusade. I can only hope that subsequent installments will shine some light on Old Night and past eras during which events on Terra engendered the consolidation by the one who would become Emperor, and which in turn led to the galaxy-spanning Great Crusade. Having said that, Abnett nevertheless offers a number of glimpses that, once more, demonstrates that there is much more to what will become known as the Horus Heresy than meets the eye.Speaking of Dan Abnett, I particularly enjoyed his writing style. His narrative flows well, and he sets a crisp pace when the plotlines demand it. Yet he creates a good balance by slowing down the rhythm when storytelling must take over, and the man is gifted when it comes to dialogue. Moreover, I was impressed by how he was a master of battle sequences, and still could create ambiguous three-dimensional characters forced to deal with moral dilemmas in these uncertain times. Since The Horus Heresy is a group effort being written by a number of authors, it remains to be seen if the rest of the gang can write as well as Dan Abnett. But one thing is for sure: I''ll be sampling more Abnett works in the future.The most satisfying aspect of this novel was the characterization. Given the premise, I was expecting a number of faceless warriors with no personality, with very few characters rising above the rest. I couldn''t have been more wrong. Of course, not every character stands out. But there are quite a few that show a lot of depth and personality. Chief among them is Garviel Loken, principal POV character. Additional well-defined characters include the other members of the Mournival, Aximand, Abaddon, and Torgaddon. The presence and POVs of civilians such as the Primary iterator, Kyril Sindermann, and various remembrancers allow readers to see the events unfold from a totally different perspective. And though Horus Rising weighs in at only 412 pages, there is a surprising amount of character development and growth throughout it pages. The seeds of heresy are sown. . .All in all, Dan Abnett''s Horus Rising exceeded my expectations and made me want to discover what happens next! An interesting and intelligent blend of action and multilayered storytelling, Horus Rising should please a lot of science fiction fans out there.At least where this title is concerned, tie-in fiction can indeed stand against most science fiction/space opera offerings found on the market today. Whether or not the rest of The Horus Heresy can live up to the expectations created by its opening chapter remains to be seen. But Dan Abnett got me; hook, bait, and sinker!Give Horus Rising a shot.

The Word Bearers Legion arrives to find the planet in ruins. No enemy did this. The destruction had been ordered by the Emperor of Mankind himself. Lorgar has spent over a century conquering worlds in the name of his father. He spent an untold amount of time upon each, patiently teaching the Word of his god-emperor. The emperor has waited over a full century before finally coming to Monarchia, destroying it, and then informing Lorgar and his Word Bearers that all of their achievements were worthless and that the entire Legion is an utter failure. But worst of all, they are told that everything they had taught to the people on every world they conquered had been a lie. The Word Bearers had been a Legion founded on faith, and now they find themselves faithless. The final humiliation is when the emperor leaves his watchdogs, called the Custodians, with orders to report back to him as they witness the Legion''s righting each planet they have wronged.Lorgar believes that humanity is nothing without faith. If his father, the Emperor of Mankind, is not a god after all, then the gold-skinned primarch would seek out a place where gods and mortals meet - seeking divinity in a galaxy his father believes is godless. The Word would change. But first the truth must be learned. No Astartes is as loyal to their Primarch as the XVII are to Lorgar. Their pilgrimage takes them to a new place, far beyond where any other had gone before. At the edge of reality they find the Eye of Terror. From the entities within the Warp, Lorgar will learn the Primordial Truth.**** FOUR STARS! This installment of the Heresy Series follows the fall of Lorgar. The entire story is imbued with emotional conflicts, confrontations, revelations, and allegations. This tale explains how the Chaos Marines came about. The author paints rich and vivid scenes as he shows readers the events from the perspective of the Word Bearers Legion.I only have one problem; in my personal opinion, Part Two starts off badly. It tells about a chapter''s worth of the story and then back tracks. This means I began with the same characters, but totally confused by the large jump in time, place, and how the damage surrounding Argel Tal (one of Lorgar''s most trusted) came about. When the story finally caught up to where Part Two began, it was all repeated and I felt a bit irritated that I had to (basically) read it all over again. I believe it would have been better had Part Two simply began with Argel Tal''s ship coming out of the Warp in critical condition and then continued from there. Again, however, that is only my opinion.As I finished reading, I could not help but recall an old adage (with a slight twist): Evil is in the eye of the beholder. Author Aaron Dembski-Bowden has done a masterful job of telling this pivotal event from the viewpoint of the Word Bearers Legion. ****Reviewed by Detra Fitch of Huntress Reviews.');

Without fail, it is usually poorly written and makes far to many thinly veiled references to the "game" beneath the story.  And where a game has developed strong back-story (often over many years), it''s usually true that a full-fledged novelization rarely does justice to the fragmented and wonderfully vague image I have in my head.And while "Horus Rising" manages to steer clear of references to the tabletop game, it definitely doesn''t quite live up to what I''d half-imagined over the many years that I have followed Game''s Workshop''s Warhammer 40''000 universe.Somehow, I''d hoped that the writers would have left off telling things directly from the point of view of any of the Space Marines - let alone some of the biggest names in the story like Horus and Abbadon.  By giving us an intimate and unfiltered look at these characters, much of the mystique that I''d so loved about the tale of the Heresy is laid bare.  And unfortunately, while Abnett is a decent writer, he doesn''t quite have what it takes to lend these characters the depth and power that they''ve always had in my own imagination.To me, it might have been better to tell this story in a different format.  Perhaps a collection of 3rd party accounts or logs from some of the Imerial Guardsmen that were present during key engagements would have left us with all of the story without over-exposing the details.Regardless, "Horus Rising" does what it set out to do fairly well.  It tells the tale of the time shortly before the corruption and fall of Horus and the beginning of humanity''s bloodiest civil war.I''ll continue to read the books with hops that their quality stays at least this good and that some of my own favourite characters (Kharne, Ahriman) will show up eventually.');

To do so, the ship must enter the warp unprepared and its crew must survive the horrors it throws at them.***** Much of this story will make no sense to anyone that has not read the previous titles. I strongly suggest that this saga be read in order. This book begins shortly before Garviel Loken and the others drop onto Isstvan III. I, as the reader, relive those events from Garro''s point-of-view rather than Loken''s. The author did an excellent job describing the chaos, confusion, and horrors. He even brings some new characters into the saga''s mix. A cadre from the Divisio Astra Telepathica, led by the Oblivion Knight Sister Amendera Kendel, enter the story. James Swallow clearly shows why the Silent Sisterhood is to be feared by the Emperor''s enemies. I am eager to learn more of that Chapter. Encore! *****Reviewed by Detra Fitch of Huntress Reviews.');

For Pelagia Iannis the cost of transition is heavy.  Daughter of the village''s widower doctor, she is caught up in global forces beyond her ken.  The imperial ambitions of Italy''s dictator, Benito Mussolini, bring the Italian army of occupation.  Among the troops is Captain Antonio Corelli, artillery officer and musician.  An unwitting and hesitant imperial minion, he is billeted in the Iannis household.  Although the doctor urges passive resistance, Pelagia, although committed to a partisan youth, is drawn to Corelli''s musical talents and unworldly charm.  De Bernieres weaves an intricate tale of love, war, humour and pathos with unrivaled skill.  His characters sparkle with realism, an aspect permeating this outstanding work.  His descriptions of the interactions of the differing nationalities and ideologies ring vividly true.As he builds the story through the characters and events, de Bernieres gives little away.  There are continual surprises as events twist and bend the characters.  Some break, others find a means to extricate themselves from a tangling fate.  Pelagia bears the main burden throughout.  Her love for Corelli, after a fitful start, blossoms, then is tested by the swirl of events.  Other characters come into her life, remain or depart.  All make some impact as de Bernieres adroitly builds her role.  Each chapter becomes a minor tale in its own right, with all tied together flawlessly.  Characters and events are imparted with meticulous detail, yet, like a Mozart opera, not one word would bear excision.If you like a story that successfully ranges over a variety of issues and people, you will seek far and wide to surpass this tale.  De Bernieres'' skills in portraying life''s complexities, yet maintaining reader attention and interest are peerless.  He has clearly build his work on thorough scholarship - there''s even a source list at the end.  His sweeping view will leave you exhilarated and breathless, but fulfilled.

Such a masterful mix of comedy and tragedy is rare, indeed. In parts I couldn''t stop laughing, much to my sleeping husband''s annoyance as I read it late into  the night. Then unstoppable tears would flow. De Berniers''s obvious love of  his characters, his painstaking research, his use of challenging vocabulary  that often sent me gleefully into the dictionary, his masterful unfolding  of plot -- all combined to keep me in continual awe of his writing. And  now, about THAT ending: Yes, there was a definite shift from the intricate  details of most of the book, which covered a relatively short period of  time. But to cover decades in that same detailed style would be utterly  impossible! (Unless it becomes a multi-volume epic, which I believe in this  case would be unsustainable.) I was impressed, actually, that De Berniers  was able to give enough details to make the unfolding of those decades not  too rushed. It was like travelling on a speeding train through the  landscape, but stopping long enough in some places to get one''s bearings,  get a decent feel for the time and place, and even go into some shops and  have a nice meal and a chat with the locals. I LIKED the way De Berniers  constructed the "bridge", then, from the war to the present, to  what we can see and experience on the island of Cephalonia today. As far as  the culmination of the love-story is concerned, without giving away the  ending, I found it satisfying and realistic. The characters remained  essentially consistent, although circumstances and their lives had  drastically changed. The criteria for a good ending, as far as I''m  concerned, is that I feel satisfied, that it feels "right", and  that I couldn''t completely predict it, although some hints were pointing me  in that general direction. It met those criteria for me.');

As talented as I believe this author to be, I cannot help but notice the huge changes in the mood swings and attitude of Horus. The character is no longer as careful and seldom checks for facts any more. No longer does The Mournival whisper words of wisdom and advice in the Warmaster''s ear. To me, it did not even seem to be a gradual change. The character is simply not believable to be the same Horus from the first book''s foundation. I found the men of the Astarte to be just as unbelievable in their undisciplined behavior while Horus is in the void. Thankfully, that did not continue as long as I thought it might. Everything else is done well. The ending is a bit rushed to me, but still well done.

That, I think, is the point of the novel.  The changes brought about to Sulaco by the use of foreign capital and technology brought about stability, peace and prosperity. They were beneficent to the population. The harm they brought was indirect, subtle and inevitable. This is not an action/adventure novel. it is a classic tragedy.The novel is based on the contrast between two characters - Nostromo, the title character, and Charles Gould. it is important that both of these characters are foreigners to the region - Nostromo - Genoese and Gould English as well as Costaguanan. It is also important that they go by multiple names Nostromo, Gian Battista, Captain Fidanza, and the Capitaz and Charles Gould as Don Carlos, Charles, Charley and the administrator of the San Tome mine. This is important because these names are not just different labels for the same persons but notifiers for personas that have markedly different social and personal implications. A major theme of this book is that the economic forces created by the new technologies introduced to the region affect the personalities of these characters. These impersonal forces change what they value and how they act. Both Gould and Nostromo become captives of the silver from the mines. They lose things that that are valuable in their lives. The things they value are changed. They do not do this by conscious choice but unconsciously with the impetus of these outside influences.The changes in Costaguna are beneficial and harmful at the same time. They bring peace and prosperity but the old community that existed there is inevitably lost. This is not an adventure novel. It is not a tale of fighting and daring-do. It is a novel in which the plot is moved forward within the description of characters. It is an analysis of the economic forces which shape values and which shapes how people live. It is a tragedy because these changes have good and ill contained inescapably within them.');

A novel of huge scope and political intrigue, it is also a novel in which no character actually wins.  All must accept the ironies which fate has dealt them.  Setting the novel in the imaginary South American country of Costaguana, the story centers around a silver mine in the mountains outside of the capital, Sulaco, vividly depicting its allure and the price each character pays for its success.When Charles Gould, returns from England to claim and reopen the rich silver mine he has inherited from his father, he has good intentions-- to provide jobs for the peasants and contribute to the economy of the town at the same time that he also profits.  Soon, however, he becomes obsessed with wealth and power, and as the political climate gets hotter, he must pay off government officials, bandits, the church, and various armed revolutionaries to be able to work.  Each of these groups is vividly depicted as working for its own ends and not for the good of the people, and with their goals focused on the real world, these characters have no self-awareness, nor do they develop it during the novel.In contrast to these "unrealized" humans, Conrad presents several characters who develop some self-awareness through their experiences.  Nostromo, a local legend, is a man of principle who has always kept his word.  Martin Decoud, a newspaper man, is a nihilist who has editorialized against the revolution, though he has yet to test himself.  Dr. Monygham, captured during a past revolution, broke under torture, and is now seeking absolution by fighting against this revolution. And the good and long-suffering wife of Charles Gould, Dona Emilia, who has lost her husband to his silver mine, now devotes her life to helping others.When Nostromo agrees to protect a load of silver from revolutionaries by taking it out to sea, he takes Decoud with him, leaving him on an island with the silver when they almost sink.  Decoud''s reaction to his isolation, and Nostromo''s reaction to the treasure that is suddenly "his," provide a dark commentary on idealism and human nature.  In the conclusion, which includes a love story that feels tacked on, Conrad''s darkest self is revealed, offering little hope of change and even less hope for man''s redemption.  Rich in atmosphere, vibrant in description, filled with characters representing all walks of life and philosophy, and set in a country where revolution is a way of life, the novel is full of dark portents and bleak political outcomes.

Alongside the larger group of natives and other people of color or lower class there is a small core group of Europeans, among those the Goulds.  In spite of being third generation South American Charles Gould still goes to England to find a wife.  Later when he decides to develop the silver mine he inherits from his father he goes to the United States to find a rich investor.  The silver mine becomes a huge success, only to become the target of political revolutionaries, and the story really begins when there is an attempted coup and takeover of the silver mine.  Much attention is given to inner conflicts and tough moral choices that individuals are forced to.Detailed descriptions of both characters and settings makes this novel quite a dense reading experience, particularly the first section which contains very little dialogue and reads like a documentary.

I had forgotten all but the nighttime flight up the lake into Switzerland. Perhaps Hemingway was of that mind but I never have fathomed why anyone in the First  War would have voluntarily joined the Italian Army to supervise ambulance drivers. Or why anyone would have gone to Spain to fight in war not their own. But that was Hemingway - his story was that the evils of war was everyone''s business. In this story there is essential courage and dedication until the realities of war (any war is a vicious interlude in our lives) bring out the realities and barbarism that comes over individual men when every moment could be life or death. And I do not find it difficult that either Henry or Catherine in the midst of a passionate discovery of each other would eventually flee to the safety of Switzerland.  I found Rinaldo unnecessary to the story and somehow offensive; on the other hand, I found the Count delightful with his two bottles of champagne a day at 94, hoping to reach 100. For me, there were many sections that were long and drawn out far beyond what was requited in the story - but that is Hemingway and  he is the one with the Nobel and the Pulitzer.  But lurking under and alongside this story there is cruelty and sadness that Hemingway cannot seem to evade, and while he tries to make it a noble sacrifice at first, it later descends into tragedy. So far in my re-reading of Hemingway he has been excellent at turning a beautiful and passionate love into a hopeless tragedy.

There is no calculus involved in this course, nor is it a "math" based physics course: Rather, it is an introduction to most topics fundamental to physics. For the purposes of academicia, this book is essentially useless. Its coverage of topics attempts to be too many things at once: As a student, I got the impression that it was an attempt to cover everything, but with as little complexity as possible.Thus, one is left with a sense of surface understanding, but very few abilities for application.This book was purchased as a method by which I could introduce myself to topics covered in class. The theory behind this was that if i learned the basics from an outside source, then when we covered them (more in-depth and mechanical, less layman''s-terms). This book provides an overly-simplified, dumbed-down portrayal of physics.If you''ve never taken any physics courses and have - literally - no background in mechanics (and a weak background in algebra-based math), then this book may be perfect for you: It is a gentle, superficial introduction to the most basic concepts of physics. There basic discussion of Newton''s laws of motion, some kinetic/potential energy discussion, etc: All topics common to most non-math physics courses. Additionally, while brief explanations of major laws and motions are given, there are very few practice problems and application instances. Thus, you''ve learned - in theory - say, Newton''s Second Law. But the book, in no way, guides you through an application of said law.Simply, it is a gentle introduction - and very gentle, at that - to the world of physics. The simple language is easy to follow, though topics are hardly covered thoroughly. But it is a good starting-off point if you are easing yourself into the study of physics (on your own). I highly recommend finding another, more thorough (and in-depth) book in order to further examine topics.');

Many strive to break from Imperial rule. Brother-Librarian Zahariel and his men, under orders from El''Jonson''s second-in-command (Luther), fight almost nonstop. An evil taint seems to suffuse parts of the planet itself. Roots and vines seethe with corruption of an awful, otherworldly sentience.Meanwhile in the stars, Lion El''Jonson believes that Warmaster Horus will attempt to take the fully-operational forge within the Tanagra system. He sends a small, hand-picked force to the keep the wealth of Diamat out of Horus''s hands. Brother-Redemptor Nemiel (cousin of Zahariel) and Brother-Sergeant Kohl lead this force. However, El''Jonson knows of another reason the Warmaster is interested in Diamat.***** FOUR AND A HALF STARS! This is the sequel to book six, Descent of Angels. Unless you read it first, you may find yourself lost in this story. Events basically pick up where Descent of Angels left off. (Zahariel and Luther land on Caliban after El''Jonson sent them away.) The author had to show what was happening on Caliban, as well as in the Crusade, and he did an admirable job of it! Zahariel and Nemiel are cousins. Zahariel is on Caliban with Luther. Nemiel is with El''Jonson in space. I found it very interesting to see how the author juggled the two similar men and how the battles end up shaping each.This well crafted story will keep your attention and perhaps give you a few surprises as well. *****Reviewed by Detra Fitch of Huntress Reviews.');

After reading the first two books, "A Wrinkle in Time" and "A Wind in the Door" I am astonished that so many readers are fascinated and entertained. I gave two stars to "Wrinkle" and thought that the other books would be much better but "Wind" is even worse. Much of this book is insanely nonsensical, like a hideous psychedelic trip.What a fiction reader enjoys is participating in "the moment," catching the mood, mentally visualizing the characters and the setting, vicariously identifying with the characters, going with the flow of the dialogue and action. I think "Wind" fails miserably to satisfy most of these elements in the reader''s experience. I was determined to finish the book but my patience was tested to the limit. After completing it I went back and decided that for one hundred pages (139-232) I could just as well have only scanned the pages, reading a few sentences on each page.

There she interacts with various good and evil spectral entities as well as delusional representations of a real person (Jenkins). She also makes extrasensory forays back to reality while ensconced in Charles. In the end her brother gets cured--I say: "Who cares how?"

Some are born posthumously."On monotono-theism:"Almost two millennia and not a single new God! But still, this pitiful God of Christian monotono-theism. This hybrid of the void, conceptualism and contradiction, this picture of decay, in which all decadence instincts, all cowardliness and weariness of soul have their sanction!""We have learned better. We have become more modest in every respect. We no longer trace the origin of man in the `spirit'', in the `divinity'', we have placed him back among the animals. We consider him the strongest animal because he is the most cunning: his spirituality is a consequence of this. On the other hand, we guard ourselves against a vanity which would like to find expression even here: that man is the secret objective of animal evolution. Man is absolutely not the crown of creation: every creature stands beside him at the same stage of perfection. And even in asserting that we assert too much: man is, relatively speaking, the most unsuccessful animal, the sickliest, the one most dangerously strayed from its instincts.""Formerly one saw in man''s consciousness, in his `spirit'', the proof of his higher origin, his divinity;  to make himself perfect man was advised to draw his senses back into himself in the manner of the tortoise, to cease to have any traffic with the earthly, to lay aside his mortal frame: then the chief part of him would remain behind, `pure spirit.'' We have thought better of this too: becoming-conscious, `spirit'', is to us precisely a symptom of a relative imperfection of the organism, as an attempting, fumbling, blundering, as a toiling in which an unnecessarily large amount of nervous energy is expended - we deny that anything can be made perfect so long as it is still made conscious. `Pure spirit'' is pure stupidity.""The word `Christianity'' is already a misunderstanding. In reality there has only been one Christian, and he died on the cross. The `Christian'', that which has been called Christian for two millennia, is merely a psychological misunderstanding."Even with the most modest claim to integrity one must know today that a theologian, a priest, a pope does not merely err in every sentence he speaks, he lies. The priest knows as well as anyone that there is no longer any `God'', any `sinner'', any `redeemer.'' All the concepts of the church are recognized for what they are: the most malicious counterfeiting there is for the purpose of disparaging nature and natural values; the priest himself is recognized for what he is: the most dangerous kind of parasite, the real poisonous spider of life. The concepts `Beyond'', `Last Judgement'', `immortality of the soul'',  the `soul'' itself; they are instruments of torture, they are forms of systematic cruelty by virtue of which the priest has become master, stays master."On the stupidity of the "Gospels":"That strange and sick world to which the Gospels introduce us - a world like that of a Russian novel, in which the refuse of society, neurosis and childish idiocy seem to make a rendez-vous... One has to regret that no Dostoyevsky lived in the neighbourhood, I mean someone who could feel the thrilling fascination of the sublime, the sick and the childish.""A certain sense of cruelty towards oneself and others is Christian; hatred of those who think differently; the will to persecute. Mortal hostility against the masters of the earth, against the noble (one allows them the body, one wants only `the soul''). Hatred of mind, of pride, courage, freedom, libertinage is Christian; hatred of the senses, of the joy of the senses, of joy in general is Christian.""In Christianity, neither morality nor religion come into contact with reality at any point. Nothing but imaginary causes (`God'', `soul'', `ego'', `spirit'', `free will''), nothing but imaginary effect(`sin'', `redemption'', `grace'', `punishment'', `forgiveness of sins'').  Relationships among imaginary beings (`God'', `spirits'', `souls''); an imaginary natural science (anthropocentric; complete lack of the concept of natural causes); an imaginary psychology (nothing but self-misunderstandings, interpretations of pleasant or unpleasant general feelings), an imaginary teleology (`the kingdom of God'', `the Last Judgement'', `eternal life'').This purely fictitious world is distinguished from the world of dreams, very much to its disadvantage, by the fact that the latter mirrors reality, while the former falsifies, devalues and denies reality.  Once the concept `nature'' had been devised as the concept antithetical to `God'', `natural'' had to be the world for `reprehensible''. This entire fictional world has its roots in hatred of the natural (reality!), it is the expression of a profound discontent with reality.""Pure spirit is pure lie. So long as the priest, that denier, slanderer and poisoner of life by profession, still counts as a higher kind of human being, there can be no answer to the question: what is truth? One has already stood truth on its head when the conscious advocate of denial and nothingness counts as the `re-presentative of Truth''."On Epicurus vs. "Saint" Paul:"One must read Lucretius to understand what it was Epicurus opposed: not paganism but `Christianity'', which is to say the corruption of souls through the concepts of `guilt'', `punishment'' and `immortality''. He opposed the subterranean cults, the whole of latent Christianity - to deny immortality was already in those days a real redemption. - And Epicurus would have won, every mind of every account in the Roman Empire was an Epicurean: then Paul appeared.""What Paul himself did not believe was believed by the idiots among whom he cast his teaching. His requirement was power; with Paul the priest again sought power - he could employ only those concepts, teachings, symbols with which one tyrannizes over masses, forms herds.""Christianity makes a thousand promises but keeps none. On the heels of the `glad tidings'' came the worst of all: those of Paul. In Paul was embodied the antithetical type to the `bringer of glad tidings'', the genius of hatred, of the vision of hatred, of the inexorable logic of hatred. What did this dysangelist not sacrifice to his hatred!The redeemer above all: he nailed him to his cross. The life, the example, the teaching, the death, the meaning and the right of the entire gospel - nothing was left once this hate-obsessed counterfeiter had grasped what he alone could make use of. Not the reality, not the historical truth.""Everything well-constituted, proud, high-spirited, beauty above all, is hurtful to Christian eyes and ears. I recall the saying of Paul: `God hath chosen the weak things of the world, the foolish things of the world, base things of the world, and things which are despised,'': that was the formula. God on the cross, is the fearful hidden meaning behind this symbol still understood? Everything that suffers, everything that hangs on the cross is divine. Christianity was a victory, a nobler disposition perished by it. Christianity has been up till now mankind''s greatest misfortune.""In my Genealogy of Morals I introduced for the first time the psychology of the antithetical concepts of a noble morality and a ressentiment morality, the latter deriving from a denial of the former: but this latter corresponds totally to Judeo-Christian morality. To be able to reject all that represents the ascending movement of life, well-constitutedness, power, beauty, self-affirmation on earth, the instinct of ressentiment here become genius had to invent `another world'' from which that Life Affirmation would appear evil, reprehensible."On Christianity as the breeding of a sick herd:"The problem I raise here is not what ought to succeed mankind in the sequence of species, but what type of human being one ought to breed, ought to will, as more valuable, more worthy of life, more certain of the future.This more valuable type has existed often enough already: but as a lucky accident, as an exception, never as willed. He has rather been the most feared, he has hitherto been virtually the thing to be feared - and out of fear the reverse type has been willed, bred, achieved: the domestic animal, the herd animal, the sick animal, the Christian.""One should not embellish or dress up Christianity: it has waged a war to the death against the higher type of man, it has excommunicated all the fundamental instincts of this type, it has distilled evil, the `evil one'', out of these instincts - the strong human being as the type of reprehensibility, as the `outcast.'' Christianity has taken the side of everything weak, base, ill-constituted, it has made an ideal out of opposition to the preservative instincts of strong life; it has depraved the reason even of the intellectually strongest natures by teaching men to feel the supreme values of intellectuality as sinful, as misleading, as temptations.""I call an animal, a species, an individual depraved when it chooses, when it prefers, what is harmful to it. I consider life itself instinct for growth, for continuance, for accumulation of forces, for power: where the will to power is lacking there is decline.""Christianity is called the religion of pity. Pity stands in antithesis to the heathy emotions  which enhance the energy of the feeling of life:  it has a depressive effect. One loses force when one pities. The loss of force which life has already sustained through suffering is increased and multiplied even further by pity. Suffering itself becomes contagious through pity.This depressive and contagious instinct thwarts those instincts bent on preserving and enhancing the value of life: both as a multiplier of misery and as a conservator of everything miserable it is one of the chief instruments for the advancement of décadence - pity persuades to nothingness! One does not say nothingness - one says `the Beyond'' or `God'' or `True life''.""What a theologian feels to be true must be false: this provides almost a criterion of truth. It is his deepest instinct of self-preservation which forbids any part of reality whatever to be held in esteem or even spoken of. Wherever the influence of the theologian extends value judgement is stood on its head, the concepts `true'' and `false'' are necessarily reversed: that which is most harmful to life is here called `true,'' that which enhances, intensifies, affirms, justifies it and causes it to triumph is called `false''.""When the prerequisites of ascending life, when everything strong, brave, masterful, proud is eliminated from the concept of God; when he declines step by step to the symbol of a staff for the weary, a sheet-anchor for all who are drowning; when he becomes the poor people''s God, the sinner''s God, the God of the sick par excellence, and the predicate `saviour'', `redeemer'' as it were remains over as the predicate of divinity as such: of what does such a transformation speak? Such a reduction of the divine?""The Christian conception of God - God as God of the sick, God as spider, God as spirit - is one of the most corrupt conceptions of God arrived at on earth: perhaps it even represents the low-water mark in the descending development of the God type. God degenerated to the contradiction of life,  instead of being its transfiguration and eternal Yes! In God a declaration of hostility toward life, nature, the will to life! God, the formula for every slander of this world, for every lie about `the next world''. In God nothingness deified, the will to nothingness sanctified.""If one shifts the center of gravity of life out of life into `the Beyond'' - into nothingness - one has deprived life itself of its center of gravity. The great lie of personal immortality destroys all rationality, all naturalness of instinct - all that is salutary, all that is life-furthering, all that holds a guarantee of the future in the instincts henceforth excites mistrust. So to live as if there is no longer any meaning in living: that now becomes the meaning of life.""What sets us apart is not that we recognize no god, either in history or in nature or behind nature - but that we find that which has been revered as `God'' not godlike, but pitiful, absurd, harmful, not merely an error, but a crime against Life."');

He portrays Christianity in gory  detail as the religion of revenge, dishonesty, small-mindedness and pity  which it is, and a leading cause of the west''s descent into nihilism. (A  reading of this book almost forms a mini spiritual biography of  western  civilisation of the last three centuries). The adherence to a religion like  Christianity forms a sort of enslavement to an outdated meaning system thus  causing anyone with a scrap of intellectual integrity to lie to theirselves  as a means of supporting a bankrupt world-view and  while appropriate for  Zarathustra''s "last men", is death for all higher types, and had  waged a bitter war against all manner of vitality, stregnth and honour  which are the hallmarks of die ubermensche. He talks of the  psychology of  the priest and the natural hatred of science that they all possess as well  as the slave morality and cowardice that Christianity promotes, but for all  the vim that the book possesses, it is not a very scholarly work, and  contains many errors. Nietzsche understandably finds it difficult to  restrain himself, but this gives the work a sort of amateurish tone.  Mencken has done a wonderful job here -- all the more because he had a deep  appreciation for Nietzsche -- the man and his work. For those who cannot  understand Nietzsche''s "hatred" of Christianity, I would  recommend a very thorough reading of the Geneology of Morals, which goes  into much greater detail and is much more scholarly and will provide better  insight into the anti-Chrsitian perspective.

The publisher, Simon Pulse, lists it as science fiction, but this is not the case. Although it contains some very interesting sci-fi themes, it is essentially a fantasy novel, like its two sequels.Card offers us the story of a young man named Rigg Sessamin, who grows up in the wilderness where he discovers that he has the gift of ''seeing'' the pathways of other living creatures and where they have been. He is a sort of super-tracker but of what use is this gift? Card then introduces more characters, and these people have the gift of shifting in time. With one character seeing all these pathways and another character able to move in time and the two of them getting together to jump to certain spots in time, the story takes a different shape, but not for the better. The most interesting aspect of this novel for me was the opening scenes of each chapter, where the pilot of a starship outward bound from Earth has a series of exchanges with an entity called an expendable, who also interacts with the ship''s computers. Enter the themes of relativity and time dilation and artificial intelligence etc. They are the most intriguing things in the entire novel, and my reason for awarding even three stars here. If left at that, this novel would work as a fine sci-fi story. But it degenerates into a very poor dirge of fantasy.The novels, an attempt by Card to tackle the issues and paradoxes of time travel,  never panned out very well with any other writers. The complexity (or philosophy) involved make it nearly impossible to tell a coherent story. It is a topic better left to short story humor writing.RUINS**starsAs an immediate sequel, this book really hit bottom. I had expected to see more intriguing dialogue and ideas, but instead, the story headed rapidly into the far-fetched zones of pure fantasy. So much so that I find it hard to see why Card even bothered to write it. The scattered themes could have been incorporated into the first novel, perhaps strengthening that one good effort. Card utilizes the dreaded information dumps in all of the conversations, in which character is not only severely limited in development but in which a group of child-like semi-heroes have fun playing God with the history of their world. Tales of time travel and its consequences hits an all-time low here. Almost all of it is unbelievable, but Card trucks on in this dismally developed attempt of a novel. In the infamous last line of the book [“See?” said Vadesh. “See how you clutter up the world?”], I have to ask: see, Mr Card, how you clutter up the reader with unworkable ideas?VISITORS**starsVisitors merely carries on the story of Rigg and Umbo and his companions as they endeavor to save the world for humans. There are tidbits of interesting dialogues and subplots, but the impact of the larger story falls flat. Perhaps Card was having some extended fun with the idea of time travel and the manipulation of history that time travel purports to hold. But it doesn''t work because there are far too many paradoxes involved, especially those of unforeseen consequences. Rigg and his many clones come to be virtual gods  in their strange abilities, and as such, they are given too much of an advantage over the average protagonist.

It feels like a bit of Terry Brooks and a bit of Orson Scott Card''s "Ender''s Game" thrown together.Rigg has been constantly trained by his father on how to survive in and deal with the world on all levels, from hunting to financing. Father has kept secrets from Rigg, which Rigg discovers when his future suddenly becomes uncertain.Rigg is put on a journey with people who have special talents to influence time. While on this journey Rigg discovers how dangerous the world is and how his world can be manipulated with time travel.This book goes between two parts, with the main focus on Rigg''s travels. The part about Rigg has an Old World feel to it, like Terry Brooks'' Shannara series. The science fiction part takes place on a space ship. Throughout the book you know the two parts are connected, and it becomes clearer how they are connected as you progress through the book.I enjoyed reading the parts on the space ship and figuring out how it connected with the story of Rigg and his friends. It is definitely a book that requires the reader to think and to figure out how they are connected.I do feel distant from the characters and was unable to become attached to anyone in particular, which is probably due to the writing style of third person narration. So, while I enjoyed the book, I did not become emotionally attached to it and so it left little impact on me.This book is the first of three and it does have a bit of closure at the end and I do believe I will read the second book...but wait for the paperback edition.');

While this gives an interesting opportunity for the reader to read about the adventures of the Terran Marines on Halo that were not seen at all during a large stretch of the game, and a subplot about a Covenent Elite''s quest for honor and vengeance against our dear friend Master Chief, the book suffers somewhat compared to the other 2 in the series simply because of the timeframe it''s set in.Most people who read this book have already played through the single-player portion of Halo on the Xbox or PC, and having to read through a section that they''ve already experienced was slightly tedious for me.  Sections such as The Library, which was considered by many to be one of the more monotonous areas of the game, became almost a chore to read through; I slogged through it once, I don''t want to slog through it again in print!Still, the battle scenes are well written and showed a familiarity with the Halo universe; all the major characters such as the Master Chief, Cortana, and Captain Keyes are consistent with what we''ve come to expect from the game and Nylund''s novels in the series, and I was hard-pressed to find any technical discrepancies with the established canon.  The Terran Marine contingent''s fight for survival with the Covenent is also quite riveting, filling in some of the blanks that were left in the game.  Halo: The Flood is a wonderful way for people who may not be into gaming to continue with the sci-fi story that Bungie wrote for the game, and is a solid read for those who finished it.So, as a book on its own, Halo: The Flood gets 4 stars in my opinion.  If you''ve already completed the game, then I''ll downgrade my rating to 3.5 stars.  While the other two books in the Halo series are better, this is still a solid sci-fi read!');

In the beginning I had not realised it at all. Of course, I saw that the story was set in the 70s, but I had not noticed it was actually written in that decade. This is significant because if you read such a dated technological thriller you expect, however, to perceive a certain naivety and a very different atmosphere from recent novels, because time changes in both the writing and the audience. The readers are now much better prepared and savvy than those of 1972, so the fact that a book of this type is able to astonish them is no doubt a sign that this is a great book.However you can notice this is one of the first works of Crichton. Over time he has definitely improved in style, but even then, as I have seen in "Andromeda", you could see his genius.The plot has to do with the treatment of mental illnesses through advanced techniques of manipulation of the brain by means of its connection to a computer, making precisely the man nothing more than a terminal. As usual in books of this author the science becomes the main protagonist. The characters take a back seat, but no matter, because the reader is captivated by everything else, although in fact it is a decades-old science fiction. The wonder of reading, however, is intact, as well as the feeling at the end of the novel that it is able to teach us something and it was not just a pastime.The ending is perhaps not unexpected, as well as the general development of the plot, but proves to be a match for other great novels of the same genre written much more recently.As always, before Crichton, I can only bow.Rita Carla Francesca Monticelli, author of Red Desert - Point of No Return');

Harry Benson has violent blackouts where he attacks people and does not remember what happens. So when Dr. Pherson decides to operate on Harry Benson to stop the blackouts, he plants a soft of pacemaker for the brain to stop it. The operation goes successful, but Harry Benson is soft of a paranoid individual who thinks that computers are taking over the world. Harry is a programmer, so he has that kind of thought running through his head. The operation has proven successful with chimps, except that they snatch out the wires, so this is their first time doing it on a human. The sort of pacemaker is about as big as a pack of cigarette''s and is implanted in his shoulder. The thing works as sending shocks to the brain where it gives off sort of like a good signal. Then something goes wrong. Harry now knows how to get the good shocks by himself, and escapes from the hospital. Now they are on the lookout for him, it is then that he tries to kill one of the female doctors who worked on him, and kills a stripper who brought him earlier a black wig and a couple of other things. He kills her also. While on the lookout for him, he sneaks back into the hospital and hides in the basement to destroy the huge computer they have there. Eventually he is found and killed.Though the novel is pretty old, some of the things discussed in this novel are actually real.

Now he suffers from increasingly frequent episodes of psychomotor epilepsy during which he explodes in violence.  A hospital team has developed a treatment that they think may help him: by implanting electrodes in his brain, they can short-circuit a seizure before it starts and prevent the violent episodes.  But Dr. Janet Ross, Benson''s psychiatrist, and her mentor, Dr. Manon, have serious reservations.  Benson''s psychosis has caused him have a morbid dread that machines are taking over the world.  Having a micro-computer implanted into his brain may cause him to feel that the doctors have turned him into a machine.  Harry isn''t going to like that.  And when Harry is upset, all kinds of unpleasant things can happen.In "The Terminal Man", Crichton explores a theme was the focus of his later best-seller "Jurassic Park": just because a scientific experiment can be done doesn''t mean it should be.  The doctors at Benson''s hospital are gung-ho over this experiment; they''ve been looking for a subject to test it out on and Benson seems perfect.  But Benson isn''t a laboratory rat; he''s highly intelligent and learns how to control the micro-computer implanted in his brain cells until soon he''s having almost continuous stimulations.  At this point, he tips over, and the ensuing mayhem proves that Ross''s worst fears were more than justified."The Terminal Man" suffers from Crichton''s trademark lack of characterization; his characters are cardboard cutouts who don''t really engage us; we aren''t interested in them as people.  But he''s one helluva storyteller, and he knows how to explain scientific complexities to lay readers in terms that make the whole thing comprehensible.  (I''ve always thought Crichton would make a great high school science teacher for that very reason.)  His annotated bibliography at the end of the book includes thirty-six references for further reading in psychomotor epilepsy, and six for electronics.  Well, most of Crichton''s readers aren''t neurosurgeons or rocket scientists, we''re just looking for a good book that holds our interest; and on this score, Crichton delivers.');

In the previous volume, the Master Chief and Cortana manage to set the Pillar of Autumn to blow her engines after she is taken by the Covenant forces.  The explosion blew a sector out of the ringworld, knocking out most of the alien systems.  Meanwhile the Helljumpers capture the Covenant command ship, but it is already overrun with Flood carrier and combat forms, so the marines crash the ship into Halo and take out all onboard.In this novel, the Master Chief and Cortana are lurking in the vicinity of Halo in a Longsword attack craft.  They have repeatedly scanned the volume for other survivors, but none have been found.  However, they do discover an oversized Covenant ship coming out of slipspace.  Quickly powering down most systems to avoid detection, they discover that the Covenant flagship is using the same frequency bands as their equipment and Cortana manages to analyze the scattered returns sufficiently to register an object that they find to be a trio of cyropods.Using thrusters only, they maneuver the Longsword near the cyropods and the Master Chief goes EVA to bring them back inside.  Two Covenant cruisers enter the vicinity and start to move toward them.  However, a previously unnoticed Pelican drop ship hidden on an asteroid fires three missiles at the Covenanters and the cruisers turn to chase the Pelican.  The Master Chief hustles the pods onboard and Cortana seals the hatch and fires their engines.  As the Covenant ships lose the Pelican in the surrounding debris, the Master Chief takes the cruisers under fire and Cortana starts an evasion run.The Master Chief, Cortana and those on the Pelican are at large, but unable to escape, since neither craft has a Shaw-Fujikawa drive.  In fact, the only slipspace capable vessels in the system are Covenant.  The Master Chief starts making plans to take over the Covenant flagship.Meanwhile, in a flashback to the fall of Reach, it appears that the Covenant forces didn''t glass the whole planet with plasma fire.  The area occupied by the top secret ONI facility, Castlebase, was not hit from orbit, but Covenant ground forces were starting to dig their way into the underground facility.  Several SPARTAN survivors from the orbital generator facility battle rally nearby, infiltrate the enemy, hijack two Wraith tanks, destroy the digging equipment, and then slip inside the base through another entrance.In this story, the Master Chief and a few other survivors from Halo return to Reach in the captured Covenant flagship.  Cortana has gathered valuable information on Covenant weapons and slipspace technology.  Moreover, she has determined that the local Covenant forces are gathering ships to attack Earth in the very near future.  Somehow, they have to get all this critical data back to Earth as soon as possible.This story is typical of the series, in that a lot of 7.62mm ammo is expended to take out an unbelievable number of Covenant troops.  How they carry all that ammo and other munitions is a puzzler.  However, there is a semblance of a plot and a higher mission.  Best of all, some of the characters that were thought to be lost with the fall of Reach are now discovered to be alive and shooting, but the list of MIAs and KIAs is still long.The story also displays aspects of Covenant society that were not mentioned in the previous books and gives more hints about the forerunners.  However, this installment ends with humanity on the edge of destruction.

While the Flood certainly wasn''t bad, combined with the fact that it was written by a different author with a plot that most of us knew, made it a little boring but nonetheless a more indepth version of Halo.However, Nylund is back and so is his brilliant style of writing and conveying scenes of non-stop acting in First Strike.Those who have loved the series so far will continue to be impressed with the newest novel until the one which will tell the story of Halo 2.First Strike of course picks up pretty much right where Halo (The Flood) leaves off with John and Cortana floating in space in the hope of finding survivors.They find survivors and embark on a quest to find Reach and possibly any Spartan''s left on it.Without spoiling the book too much, John will have some backup for the upcoming war with the Covenant.Overall, if you haven''t read this book you''re missing out on a great preview to Halo 2 and a great read for any science fiction fan as well.');

Secondly it is a true (and much more direct) sequel to "Ghosts of Onyx", Eric Nylund''s most recent Halo novel.  Karen Traviss (who wrote Gears of War 3) takes the reigns from Nylund and runs with them though, balancing three storylines of complex moral ambiguity and intrigue. The moral implications of Dr. Halsey''s actions are explored in great detail, and while I had previously been a strong Halsey supporter (her journal that came with the Reach legendary edition is what got me reading Halo fiction in the first place), several characters have strong arguments for the "Halsey is a Monster" camp.  So we follow Halsey and the group of Spartan IIs and IIIs trapped in the Onyx Dyson sphere (the Forerunner "shield" world that they escape to in "Ghosts of Onyx)" as well as a group of ONI spooks and a few Sangheili (elites) rogues who are plotting a mutiny against the Arbiter. If nothing else, Glasslands proves that the end of the covenant war is by no means the end of interesting stories to be told in the Halo universe. In fact, it has convinced me that now that the cut and dry "good humans vs. army of evil mutants" conflict is resolved, we can now get into the meaty aftermath that has the potential to tell much more complex stories. Here we have elites who want peace with humans, elites who don''t want peace with humans, humans who want to reignite the insurrection against the UNSC, humans who want to spark a civil war between the two factions of elites, jackals who want to return to being the pirates of space and the possibility of a new (or more likely OLD) faction that I have a strong inkling will play a big part in the story for Halo 4 (if the Terminal videos in Halo: CEA are any indication). If you''ve never read a Halo book before, I''d recommend reading the Nylund books ("Fall of Reach", "First Strike" and "Ghosts of Onyx")  before "Glasslands"  as the Spartans'' storyline runs through all of these books ("The Flood" is part of that arc also, but you can just play Halo 1 to get the jist of that story) but if you make it though those three, Glasslands is a real treat.

I thought that the previous two books were excellent, but this final one blew away my expectations. It was a tremendously engaging read--like many people I often use the phrase "couldn''t put it down", but this time it was true. Karen Traviss created an incredibly human, believable, compelling ensemble of characters for the trilogy and she outdid herself with her writing this time. Even the artificial intelligence she wrote, Black-Box, comes across as more human and relatable than the protagonists of many other bestselling novels I''ve read, and I dare say some of the people that I actually know.While the past Halo books were fun expansions of the games'' universe with bits of history, world-building, and action, this trilogy--and especially Mortal Dictata--went far deeper than that. Mortal Dictata is a beautiful, deep exploration of morality, justice, and what it means to be human, at a level that I never expected out of the Halo novels (and I say that as an avid reader and fan of them) and it has earned a position as one of my three favourite books. It gives us a look at the minds of people who have done great things and terrible things to ensure the survival of the human race through a brutal war, and brings us along for the ride as they deal with the consequences of those actions.If you need a reason to read this book, it is this: Mortal Dictata asks us how far is too far to go when extinction is a real and immediate threat; if it being a novel based on a game series makes you think it won''t make you question not only your views on the subject, but the very notion of there being a right answer, I assure you that it will when it shows you--side by side and in vivid, living colour--the benefits and the human costs of actions taken for the greater good.');

In every book) That said, this is still one of my favourite books. The story is fun, the villains are a little too obvious and never change(another hallmark of card books) and, yes, he does use the making babies phrase. But it seems to work. Maybe it''s because this is more of a fantasy novel. Whatever the case, I love this book.');

He and his family are leaving Ukraine for America. On the way, they stop at Cousin Marek''s farm and while Ivan is running in the ancient woods nearby, he finds a clearing. In the middle of a clearing is a woman.  This is the beginning of Orson Scott Card''s Enchantment. When Ivan first sees this woman, he runs away. When next he returns from America to the same place -- a college student, a track star, and engaged to be married -- he faces his fear and does not run. Instead he wakes up Katerina, Princess of a place called Taina that existed over 10 centuries ago. Unwittingly, Ivan has stepped into the Russian Sleeping Beauty and has found that it isn''t a fairy tale after all.  Enchantment tells of how Ivan, unsuited to the time and culture of Taina, knowing only the language from his studies in college, and Katerina, Princess of Taina, overcome Baba Yaga, the witch who wants to end the Taina way of life and rule the country.  On Ivan and Katerina''s side is knowledge and eventually love. The two travel to Ivan''s time to prepare for the upcoming battle with Baba Yaga. They have advanced weapons, loyal people, and Ivan''s mother, who is a witch herself.  But Baba Yaga has fear on her side; the power of a spellbound god; sorcery, hatred, trickery. She will give them no easy victory.  Enchantment is a captivating story; a fairy tale so original it can hardly be recognized as a retelling. The writing is powerful; the characters are real; the issues are close to home no matter where home may be. This is a wonderful read.');

Since I began reading this book on-line, I didn''t have that hurdle. Guys, buy this book and ignore the cover, or at least SAY it is for you wife/girlfriend/daughter/neice!]This is a modern retelling of Sleeping Beauty set in the milieus of ancient and modern Russia. And if that doesn''t wet your appetite, nothing will! It tells the story of an track-star/literature student from the Soviet Union who learns that he is really Jewish. After the Velvet Revolution, Ivan returns to Russia to visit his uncle, and there he sees her: Sleeping Beauty!This book is, as only Orson Scott Card can do, is a whirlwind of adventure, time travel, several "First Contact" scenarios, and, yes, romance! I read this book simultaneously with "Timeline" by Crichton, and Mr. Card blew him out of the water! "Timeline" was rather thin and runny, like bland oatmeal. A friend of mine pointed out that the book was more of screenplay than novel, and he also showed me some of the plot holes!Mr. Card, however, told a thick, well done New York steak of a tale. The characters were well developed, and did develop in the course of the story. The secondary characters actually had a pulse, and were not cardboard cutouts. And beneath this all was an affirmation of mutual respect across culture and time barriers; the sanctity of marriage in society; and the ultimate triumph of good.Mr. Card does a superb job of crafting characters that work within family organizations. As he pointed out in his introduction to "Speaker for the Dead," most characters in books are free-roaming adolescents that run around solving other peoples problems. (Can you imagine Superman being a bishop? With all those interviews?) Card has a very tight family organization, which reflects how people really operate in the real world. Sherlock Holmes is single, and Watson''s wife is a pale shadow of a person.One interesting plot point that Mr. Card does not develop is the importance of childbearing. It is interesting that part of the plot would be predicated on pregnancy. More Mormon family values!This is one of Mr. Card''s well-crafted books.

It is on this bloated sphere that they find a young boy named Zeal. They are not sure if Zeal is even a teenager yet, but his psyker powers are extremely interesting to Ravenor. So Zeal is basically adopted by the team. Once Ravenor''s investigation is over, he will turn his full attention to the boy. It is also on this planet that clues and possible allies will be found. These lead the team to Lucky Space, where pirates, death-worlds, and worse reside. But in Lucky Space, the team''s luck finally runs out.**** FOUR STARS! Many of these characters were introduced in the Eisenhorn Trilogy; however, if you have NOT read that trilogy you will have no real trouble what-so-ever. (I have yet to read the Eisenhorn Trilogy, so I speak from experience.) Eisenhorn is mentioned only in passing and the author does a wonderful job of keeping this story totally separate from the other trilogy.I found it a bit distracting when the story switches back and forth from First person (Ravenor''s view) to Third person. Fortunately, this does not happen too often ... usually when Ravenor is in someone else''s mind/body. A very good beginning to this trilogy. ****THORN WISHES TALON (Short story)This short story takes place as Ravenor''s team is heading back to Eustis Majoris. The tale not only bridges books one and two, but also gives readers a small glimpse into a possible dark daemon manifestation in the future. Eisenhorn fans will especially enjoy this short interlude.RAVENOR RETURNS (Book 2 of trilogy)The Divine Fratery is concerned with the manifestation of a daemon called Slyte, whose occurrence they had foreseen. Orfeo Culzean, one of their foremost expediters, is employed to make the manifestation happen. The manifestation is tied into the activities of Inquisitor Gideon Ravenor. Either Ravenor or someone close to him would trigger the event which would bring Slyte into being. Even though Ravenor had been warned (by Thorn), he must still do his duty. Thus Ravenor and his warband return to Eustis Majoris.Since their enemies believe they are dead, Ravenor and his team re-enter Eustis Majoris clandestinely. They plan to infiltrate the upper levels of the Administry on the capital-world and attempt to reveal how high the corruption reaches. The team now operates under the terms of Special Condition status: rogue, driven to independence by extremis, who will act with singular devotion, and recognize no law or master save the God-Emperor himself.**** FOUR STARS! This story holds many surprises. There is very little I can say without major spoilers. To give a small teaser, not all of Ravenor''s warband will survive this mission. The team will also expand in numbers. As with book one, there are still distracting jumps in First and Third person views. ****PLAYING PATIENCE (Short story)This short story reveals how Patience Kys was located by Ravenor and joined his warband.RAVENOR ROGUE (Book 3 of trilogy)Zugmunt Molotch is a genius. He is also psychotic. His ambition is to recover enough elements of Enuncia from xenoarchaeological sites in the outworlds to master a rudimentary command of it.

Ravenor has no idea if it came true or not. The young boy, Zeal, has been in a catatonic state since he collapsed from a psychic assault at Miserimus. Ravenor''s blunter/untouchable, Frauka, sits by Zeal''s side waiting for the boy to waken. Should Zeal waken and show any signs of being the daemon''s host, Frauka is to immediately execute him.Since they are already rogue, Ravenor agrees to use a source his masters would have normally punished him for even considering. They travel to Utochre and locate the Wych House. With the help of one of the housekeepers, the group will travel several times via a portal (that resembles a door) in hopes of learning where Molotch is hiding. But will the team succeed in their quest? Is Zeal hosting the daemon, if the prophecy ever came to pass? And when it is all over, will Ravenor be able to make the ordos understand why he''s had to take the course he has?*** THREE STARS! Book three begins about six months after book two ends. The team''s numbers grow again, but as with the last book, not all will survive. I have to admit that I am a bit disappointed in this episode. Some questions were not answered.

Machiavelli would not have found these people credible either.  These characters are way "over the top" for me.  They would not have lasted in any company that I have ever run into.  I graded the book down two stars for this extreme weakness.  If you believe that there are people willing to cut every possible corner operating at the top of major American corporations, you will probably find this to be a five star book.  If you think that people who run companies are pretty much like everyone else in terms of how intrigued they are by power and money, then you will have difficulties accepting the premises of this book.The basic story line is very intriguing, building on a role reversal of the typical sexual harrassment charges.  A male executive, Tom Sanders, is accused of sexually harrassing his new female boss, and former lover.  He, in turn, accuses her of sexually harrassing him.  The incident itself turns out to be simply one scene of a five act play involving larger corporate issues.  In the process, you will learn a great deal about how sexual harrassment law has become an area where the accused and the victims both have little to gain.  Also, you will see how false charges can be used as powerful leverage inside a company or other workplace.  The book also contains interesting tidbits of information about the history of sexual harrassment and what the law describes it as.As a reader, I urge you to be patient with the sexual harrassment scene.  It is overtly phony . . . but that has a literary purpose.  I can say no more without affecting your enjoyment of the novel.John Lithgow does a tremendous job with his reading of this  abridgement.  One of my favorites amongst his stylings is a loud sniff that precedes every sentence uttered by the pompous corporate general counsel.  I could hardly keep from laughing aloud whenever Mr. Lithgow did this.  He has a very versatile voice and ability to handle many accents well, and thus moves easily among the different sexes, ages, and ethnic backgrounds of the characters.  The audio cassettes are also very well produced, and are helped by the addition of some music to heighten the tension.If you find you don''t like the beginning of the book, stick with it.  I thought that the second half of the novel was unusually well plotted and developed.  There is a virtual reality section that will amuse almost any reader.There is a mystery inside the sexual harrassment issue for Tom Sanders to solve.  For mystery fans, you will find this mystery pretty simple to unravel.  So don''t buy the book expecting the return of Sherlock Holmes.  You will probably have the mystery''s conclusion figured out within the first 25 percent of the book.  The unraveling of the mystery is done very well though, so it''s fun just to listen to how Dr. Crichton manages it.After you finish reading this book, I suggest you be sure that everyone in your workplace knows what your policies are on prohibiting sexual harrassment.  Also, be sure to have a code of ethics to cover everything that could come up, not just sexual harrassment.  With those two actions, you will probably avoid  the terrible situations described in Disclosure where you work.  That would be good for all.Encourage the pursuit of ethical profits . . . rather than profits for their own sake.');

What makes it fascinating is that Chrichton has woven a current issue -- on the job sexual harrassment -- into the heart of the story.But its not sexual harrassment the way you''d expect.  Tom Sanders  -- Digicom''s Vice President -- is harrassed by his new boss Meridth Johnson after she wins a promotion fight they both were waging.  The old story of a boss using position for sexual gratification is turned on its head -- she is in the power position, demanding performance from the man and creating an environment of retaliation at his refusal.The book is a wonderful expose of sexual harrassment by examining it from an unconventional vantage point.  This serious issue does at first look different when a man is the accuser against a female.  But this refreshing portrayal produces a first rate look at the problem.The rest of the story surrounds high tech corporate culture, market pressure, a fascinating look at virtual reality technology and the tried and true secrative corporate machinations that reveal themselves over the course of the book.I must add that the issue does not detract from the story.  It greatly enhances Chrichton''s work proving once again that he is a master story teller and a genius at weaving disparate elements into a first rate thriller.');

Also assassin shenanigans, but not as much as you''d expect. Told from a first person point of view, it lays the groundwork really well. The protagonist''s voice is strong and relatable. His telepathic relationship with his dog was fascinating and heartbreaking. The telepath training he goes through was also quite engaging. The world-building and main conflict, however, are on the mediocre side. The main kingdom the story takes place in is very standard medieval fare, except for the character naming convention of using descriptive words like Shrewd or Chivalry. These were somewhat interesting, but made it harder for me to imagine them as actual people. King Shrewd always made me think of some sort of cartoonish, anthropomorphized shrew king.The telepathy aspect of the world-building has a huge hole in it. In this world telepathy is incredibly useful, both for communication and as a weapon. It is also quite easy to teach people. And yet, for no apparent reason, virtually no one is trained in telepathy. The number of telepaths in the world seems to be in the single digits. This paradox is remarked on by one of the characters but is never actually explained.The main conflict was also quite lacking. The big reveal of the two villains is telegraphed from a mile away. Basically, the only two mean characters end up being the villains. Not a huge surprise. The other characters end up looking pretty stupid that they didn''t see it coming. The inevitable defeat of the villains isn''t very satisfying either. It just comes down to an unexplained reserve of magical power that suddenly appears at the last second. Yawn.It was overall a pretty entertaining novel, but I don''t think I''ll continue with the series.');

I''ve really loved each of the first 3 books in this series, but found this one to be uneventful filler. The last 30 pages contained all the necessary portions of the story, and rather than bore us with 200 pages of filler, this could have (and should have) been the opening chapters to book #5.  And then after wading through hundreds of pages of build-up, we''re left with a rather abrupt cliffhanger. I was honestly shocked when I turned the page to find out that the book had ended after only a few chapters of action.While I wasn''t impressed with The Necromancer, I will most definitely continue with this series.

I decided to read this because I watched season 1 of the new TV show and enjoyed it, so I figured I''d give the books a go. Oddly I liked the TV show better. A lot of people have compared this book to Harry Potter. Let me stop you right there! I went into this sort of expecting that because of some reviews I had read, but this is not that at all. The characters are kind of depressing and they really don''t even get much opportunity for you to understand them and care about them. You spend a ton of time with them but somehow come out the other end not really knowing them. The book felt like it was just endless filler, random situations that had nothing to do with anything and then 2 seconds later everyone just moves on and forgets they ever happened. I found it hard to even know what the point of the book was. The only reason I kept reading this was because I had seen the TV show and knew it had to get better eventually. But it wasn''t until the last 100 pages of the book that we FINALLY get to the point! Finally we are told the ultimate goal of these characters, when for the last 300 pages we have been left wondering what their end game was supposed to be. In the end I found that the book lacked direction and if the author did know where he was going, he didn''t do a very good job of communicating it to the reader because if I hadn''t seen the show I never would have had a clue what these people were trying to accomplish.  One thing I will say though is that the last 100 pages were very good and I enjoyed them enough to continue on and read the rest of the series.

As such, it seems reasonable to assume that they were written over a span of a great number of years.  I would have found it helpful had the original copyright dates of each entry been included so one could, in some ways, track Bradbury''s development as a writer.Having said that, I did enjoy this book for the very variety that seems to have put off some of the reviewers here.  There are stories that are pure Sci-Fi, others that are perfect examples of the horror genre, some that make us want to laugh and/or cry, and many that combine several of these aspects.One of the latter that I found particularly moving is "Lafayette, Farewell."  In it, an elderly man who knows that he is to die soon begins to relive the air battles he fought as a fighter pilot over France during World War I.  Every night, he sees and hears the planes of those brave young men who died as he successfully shot their planes out of the sky.  He now feels guilty over taking the lives of those innocent young pilots who, like himself, were sent into a war not of their own making.He fears that he will be consigned to hell for what he has done, and he asks his neighbor how he can, at this late date, be forgiven.  His neighbor suggests that, since they, in their planes, are appearing over his house nightly before parachuting to their deaths in his back yard, he plainly and simply, ask them for their forgiveness.  In a very moving scene, he does just that and they indicate that he is forgiven.This is really a touching story, one of my favorites in the book.  There are others equally rewarding to read along with some that are among Bradbury''s lesser works.  I for one, am glad to see as many of Bradbury''s stories as possible anthologized in books such as _THE TOYNBEE CONVECTOR_.  I''m afraid that those that aren''t, and which appeared in more obscure, older Sci-Fi magazines, may be lost to us forever.

It was an enjoyable read: heroic adventures set in an English, vaguely archaic, location, amongst groups of animals from the British countryside: mice, rats, badgers, moles, otters, etc. The books all share the same landscape, and some of them are focussed on the Abbey of Redwall, a haven and support for the surrounding creatures. My grandson was particularly charmed by the inventive insults traded between friend and foe, and intrigued by the various dialects (moles and hedgehogs speak English ''rustic''; hares speak upper-class twit; otters are nautical, etc.) There is plenty of action and invention, a rich vocabulary, and traditional heroic themes (courage, friendship, etc.) but all done with a light hand. I was chiefly amazed that such a very ''English'' series would be such a hit with a very American boy, who has never been outside North America; and also impressed that he read and knew the whole series (around a dozen books--and they are quite hefty books--300-400 pages).  I enjoyed Redwall quite a lot myself, and bought a couple more in the series to try out. I like the world Jacques has created, and find the stories entertaining.  The characters'' realization as animals is a bit uneven and the physical scale is vague (a badger squeezing through a tunnel dug by moles?) and sometimes the rapid intercutting of narrative strands is so rapid as to be annoying, but on the whole I think it is a brilliant series.');

The main draw is the novella that is included in this collection because it is set in the world of his Abhorsen series. There is also a short story set in the world of Shade’s Children if anyone is a huge fan of that work.They actually did not include all of the novella in this ARC, so I will need to grab a copy of this once it is published, but what I did read takes you right back into the magic of the original series. No dead show up, but the protagonist is trying to get hired by a company that guards and builds a famous bridge. He is just getting through the initial tests when they cut me off. I can’t wait to read the rest.Nix actually includes some fan fiction he wrote using other people’s characters. There is a Sherlock Holmes story, featuring Holmes’ kinds crazy relative who can solve magical crimes, and a weird little bit featuring Hellboy. I have never read fan fiction by a famous, published author before, but it works quite well.Most of the stories are either science fiction or fantasy, and he arranged them thematically. You’ve got insect-like vampires, angels being used by musketeer-like folks and LARP.One of the things I adore about Garth Nix is the sheer amount of imagination he manages to pack into everything he writes. The worlds he creates are extremely intricate and detailed and you get sucked in immediately. He creates empathetic, strong characters of both sexes and creates drama without being mushy, but he really shines the most at world creation.This collection would be a great intro to Garth Nix for those that do not already know and love him (though how many people could that actually be?). The stories are varied enough that you should be able to find something to spark your interest.');

I love most of the Redwall novels with the exceptions of ''Triss'', and ''Loamhedge''- (what was the point of that "quest" again?)Many have criticized Jacques for his "same-old" style throughout the Redwall series, but his style in these books is the exact reason I love them in the first place, so I''m happy he doesn''t change it too drastically.But after reading ''Doomwyte'', I''ve realized that maybe a little change isn''t too bad. Jacques gets back to the root style of Redwall, which old fans will recognize from ''Redwall'', ''Mossflower'', etc., yet it also has a unique element too it. The riddles, the quest, the feasts, the heroes and sundry are still there but I believe this story to stand out more from his most recent Redwall additions, probably because I can still remember the story and characters long after.''Doomwyte'' is definitely a page turner, with a mystery and an eerie feel to it- I loved that. I couldn''t put it down, and thoroughly enjoyed the whole thing.Some of Jacques recent novels of Redwall I would describe as good books, but not great. They were a nice a read, but not memorable, I don''t even remember most of the characters because they were all mediocre. This newest novel is different- the story is fresh and the characters, even the villains, stand out. If an old Redwall fan has given up the Redwall series because current books in it have disappointed them, I''d say give this one a try. It''s worth it.');

The tale revolves around the chronologically bent timeline of Judeans or Canaanites or what you will, warring on the until recently ill defined Philistines. This group was likely subdued by Pharaoh,  Ramases III, who then transplanted them to Gaza and various parts of the Egyptian kingdom that included Palestine. [But don''t let us interfere with Hollywood and OT adventures]. Yet, the teen heroes of Joshua Miller''s adventure battle with the Philistines, defeat the already defeated group, slaying their Goliath with the slingshot, with asses jawbones - and later, actually make a military pact with this Biblically vilified, vagabond, vestigial, vulgar people who are chosen a Judean deity to be genocide victims for total extermination. But even that anti New Testament, OT exhortation, does not appeal to the humanity of author Joshua Miller.His prologue captured the racist, xenophobic language of the OT with the Hebrew/Judean lads describing the brutish, no good Philistine warrior nation as insects etc - just as Palestinians are described today by the settlers of Palestine. His young hero was alsorepulsed by the sanguinary scriptural fanaticism of the Judean assassins, including their exhortation to him to kill the babies because they would grow up and want revenge. So, good for him.Miller''s metaphors and idioms are as anachronistically hilarious but would appeal to youths and millennials today. Or to rappers. I suppose his author''s licence is well used in this regard and he may feel the same about my own four novels hosted at Amazon.com. I also wished that mine had better fine editors so I truly empathise with Joshua Miller. I don''t know him but we share a mutual friend, my family physician, who asked me to review this work. So I purchased a Kindle edition.Hugs, John ISH Ishmael.Complaints to me at ISH@ISHMAEL.CA');

He is by no means perfect, but that’s where you really find yourself in the character. It’s fun to watch him grow as a character. Having a young boy imagining being a country guard in the same fashion a modernized version would have himself fantasizing about being a superhero; made Nikolas incredibly relatable.I am very excited to see where this series goes.

I knew that it would take place in ancient Israel, I knew that there would be lions and a giant involved, I knew that there would be adventure, and judging from the blurb on the back, I could assume that the writing would be fairly casual and colloquial. Now, after having read Tyrants and Traitors, I can say that I was entirely correct. What I had not predicted, however, was that this book would put quite a bit of emphasis on Yahweh, the Israeli name for God.Some of you may know, or may have suspected, that I am not a very religious person. I do not practice or participate in any one religion, but I did grow up in a religious household, and am fascinated by all sorts of religions (especially Shinto and Hinduism).Therefore, I think that it is important for you to know that I read this book from a non-religious-but-curious perspective. There was also a little nostalgia involved, as I grew up with the story of David and Goliath. I remember that my grandmother bought me an illustrated Bible/story book from a Jehovah''s witness, and that it was my favourite book for a very long time. I read it all of the time because I really enjoyed the nice and colourful illustrations, as well as most of the stories.With that out of the way, I will now get back to Tyrants and Traitors and firstly discuss the writing. The style is very engaging, as well as amusing. There were many times where I found myself laughing while reading this book. That being said, and to those of you who have read some of my past reviews this will sound repetitive, but the writing was too post-modern and colloquial or me. To be more specific, I mean that the writing was too modern when considering the setting. This book takes place in ancient Israel, and yet much of the dialogue spoken by the younger characters contained current slang.This made it a little difficult for myself to become immersed into the story. But I generally have this problem with fantasy and historical fiction, while it might not bother other readers at all. In fact, some of the younger readers (and this book is meant mainly for teens) will find the writing amusing, fun, as well as easy to follow and understand. I also liked that this book was full of action, and that there were few moments which were slow. The fight scenes were also well-described and detailed, which I appreciated, since I like to picture such scenes as thoroughly as possible.The plot overall was also interesting, full of action, some mystery, politics, and a little court intrigue. There is also a drizzle of romance, as well as a well-described setting. There is never any doubt as to where this story takes place. I recommend this book to those who enjoy adventure plots, ancient civilizations, and some plot twists. And I will definitely be reading the sequel.');

They command a whole army of sea rats and took over Castle Floret and made prisoners the royal family of Gael Squirrelking and his wife Serena and their son, Truffen.When Serena and Truffen escape the clutches of Nagru and his horde with the help of otters Rab and Iris and their band, Rab and the faithful squirrel sitter for Truffen, Muta the badger, fight off the whole army themselves. They are left for dead and Nagru and his army keep looking for Serena and Truffen using two ermine, called the evil Dirgecallers to track down the squirrel queen and her son.Meanwhile, Mariel and Dandin themselves are in serious trouble as they fight off a group of rats who are trying to kill a family of moles. Luckily, they are helped by hare Field Marshal Meldrum Fallowthorn with his four nephew leveret hares and run the rats off. The grateful moles lead them to their mole hideout and explains the circumstances of Southward. The next day they see Nagru, his army, and the Dirgecallers on the scent of Serena and Truffle. Wanting to help, they started jumping on the very top of a dune and the dune collapses on all of the rats and Nagru! Some of his rats are killed and the Dirgecallers, who were in the front, are also killed. Mariel, Dandin, and Meldrum are captured and made to starve in the highest tower in Castle Floret. The break down the door by breaking the hinges, then free the other prisoners whom one of them happens to be Gael Squirrelking! The other prisoner is Glokkpod, a great, red-backed shrike. They try to escape but there is no way out since they''re at the top of the tower and the rats have discovered their escape and are rushing in. Glokkpod helps to break open the roof to the attic and they stay there, trying to keep off the rat hordes.While all of this is going on, back at Redwall Abbey, Joseph the Bellmaker has a vision from the mouse warrior, Martin. In his vision he is told that Mariel is in danger and needs his help. He is told to go by sea towards the south and is told, "Five will ride the Roaringburn, But only four will e''er return." Using the clues, they realize that the five mentioned is Joseph, Rufe Brush the squirrel bellringer, Durry Quill the cellar hog, Foremole, and Hon Rosie, the hare. Together with the help of Log-a-log and his shrews and Finbarr Galedeep the sea otter, they steal the ship, "The Pearl Queen" (which rightfully belongs to Finbarr) to sail away to help Mariel.Will Mariel and her friends be able to escape Castle Floret? Will Serena and her friend otters try to help them? Will Joseph, the Redwall creatures, and their friends come to help fight Nagru and his army? Is it true that ''five will ride the Roaringburn, but only four will e''er return? To find out these questions, however, you''ll have to read the book yourself to find out.This book "The Bellmaker" is of the Redwall series and should be read right after reading "Mariel of Redwall. Probably my most favorite characters in this book is Dandin, Meldrum, Hon Rosie, and Rufe.

Garth Nix''s latest suffers from a bit of middle-book syndrome, but he keeps things interesting with a brewing three-way battle, a New Nithling ally, and a vampiric Trustee who sucks the experiences from her victims.Arthur is struggling with a bunch of new problems, when he is given Lady Friday''s resignation... and a transfer plate. The next thing, he''s been transported to Lady Friday''s frozen, mountainous realm. And unknown to him, Leaf has followed thousands of senior citizens (including her disabled aunt) into Friday''s realm.Arthur''s dire situation becomes even more difficult when he learns that his friends Suzy and Fred have been forcibly drafted into the Piper''s army (they''re only allowed out with a New Nithling accompanying them). And Superior Saturday is claiming control over Friday''s realm. Time is growing short for Arthur to find the fifth piece of the Will... but that can''t stop Saturday and the Piper."Lady Friday" suffers from the "middle book" syndrome -- it''s building up to the battle between Saturday, Arthur and the Piper, but not quite there yet. By the cliffhanger ending, Nix has spun up the beginnings of an epic conflict, which only promises to get nastier when Superior Saturday finally makes an appearance. And who knows what''s going to arrive with Lord Sunday?The plot is slower-moving and darker than the previous books, with lots of ruthless Denizens who want Arthur stopped, not to mention the haughty, cruel Friday stealing the good experiences from elderly mortals. And a measure of uncertainty has come into the plot, with the New Nithlings and their ambiguous loyalties. Even Dame Primus (four-sevenths of the Will) is getting unreliable.But Nix includes the occasional quirky moment to lighten all this dark stuff, such as the rather funny Beast, and the fact that the New Nithlings just want to garden. It''s a bit like Lewis Carroll writing a steampunk epic. And by the last few chapters, things speed up to breakneck pace, and even dealing with the latest Trustee won''t fix things.Arthur is under plenty of stress in this one, since every time he uses a Key, he comes closer to becoming a Denizen. So he has to rely mainly on his wits in this one, to deal with everything from savage Nithlings to Friday herself. And poor Leaf is even worse off -- she''s far away from Arthur, and surrounded by some very nasty Denizens."Lady Friday" is the buildup to the grand finale of Garth Nix''s newest series, and while it''s slower than the other books, it holds the promise of a great "Superior Saturday."');

But I got it because of their sheer encouragement, and read it all, and was quite impressed. The pace is quick and the story is delightful. The mountain of Salmandastron is inhabitaed by very old hares, badgers and other peaceful critters. All the young beasts have went elsewere, so the mountain is very vulernable to attack, if attack were to ever happen. Lord Stonepaw, the Badger Lord, sits and withers away more and more day by day at the top, but that all changes when strange events happen up until the great wildcat conquerer, Ungatt Trunn, comes and invades the mountain! Lord Brocktree sends his hare Fleescut to find reinforcements before Trunn''s attack begins, and that start his adventure through Jukka The Sling, and much more. Elsewhere, Brocktree of Brockhall stumbles into young Dotti, the "fatal beauty", and they head to the mountain together. Brocktree goes because he feels he needs to, and Dotti goes because she is sent away from her parents to her Aunt, who lives on the mountain. Now, this book starts with four main character''s adventures: Lord Brocktee & Dotti''s quest towards Salmandastron, Fleescut & Jukka Sling''s finding reinforcements, the older beasts and Stonepaw escape from the invaded mountain, and Ungatt Trunn''s daily visions of the horrible Badger Lord coming for him. In the end, they all meet (except for Trunn) and form a plan for winnign back Salmandastron.

Lord Stonepaw and his devoted hares are in desperate need of Brocktree''s help.  Meanwhile, Brocktree has teamed up with a hare maiden on his journey. They get wind of the invasion and start to round up all the fighting creatures they can find. This leads to an outrageously funny battle with a large, Scottish-sounding hare in order to gain his help. Later, of course, it leads to the climactic battle against Ungat and his troops. This book has everything for a Redwall, fantasy, or book fan. It has humor, battles, rich dialogue and character personalities, and really excellent poetry. All in all, this book is for anyone who likes to read.');

I''ve been a big fan of the Redwall books when they were first published in the USA (When was that? 1992? Somewhere there about. I wasn''t even in High School yet.) and Brian Jacques in general (I have copies of his "scary stories" books). I bought the hardcover of Redwall but never had a chance to read it when I went on a summer trip to visit relatives I''ve never even known about. I ended up buying the paperbacks in some backwater town. Since then, I''ve read and reread the first three novels (Redwall, Mossflower, Mattimeo) so many times that the paperbacks fell apart and I store them in plastic zip-lock bags. I can''t bear to throw them away. I now have hard bound editions of all the books in the series.As a 23 year adult who read so many different books, It''s a fantastic thing to read a series of books that captured the heart of so many. Although the books as of late don''t go in a direction that I want to know about. It would be nice if Brian Jacques elaborates on the history and glory of Malkariss (SP?), Or the story of the very first badger at Salamandastron, Or exactly where, when, and who makes Martin''s sword, and I''m positive that I''m not the only one who wishes Jacques would take his characters farther out into the world to meet other and more bizarre creatures. (The creatures tend to be localized around Europe. Ever noticed that there has not been one single skunk, porcupine, penguin, wallaby, or rabbit [not a hare] , etc., etc., in any of his stories?)Nevertheless, the stories are great and will quickly reach the appeal and world wide acceptance that books like Wizard of Oz has long reached. I have every intention of sharing my entire collection with my children (If any) these wonderful, thought provoking stories.I gave Lord Brocktree four stars since Brian Jacques'' stories are becoming more and more "detached" from the main thread plot. It''s great that he''s branching away from the overall Redwall environment and expanding the Redwall universe, I just hope he doesn''t stray too far. Since Jacques'' more recent stories have a very thin plot attachment to the earlier books.');

Like the similarities to the tales of King Arthur (first hint should’ve been the main character’s name...), or the fact that the main character has “age swings” rather than mood swings (i.e. at times he acts his age, others he acts unbelievably older, and other times still he seems very very young...). Probably the biggest annoyance is just how unbothered the main character is by all the events, though (goes hand in hand with his age swings, to an extent) – it just takes some of the realism away from it. I know, that’s a strange complaint to make in a fantasy novel, but I personally prefer some realism, at least when it comes to the characters. I need to be able to relate to them somehow.All of that said, however, though there were so many aspects that bothered me about it all... I honestly didn’t care! None of it detracted from my reading in the slightest.

Eons passed, and then there was The Will. The Architect''s Will was broken into seven pieces by the treacherous Trustees to prevent it from ever being executed. The first fragment was fused inside a solid crystal and then placed inside an unbreakable glass box which was locked inside an indestructible cage. The cage was anchored on the surface of a dead sun at the end of time, and was guarded by twelve sentinels, who were supervised by inspectors. These security measures may have been nothing to sneeze at, but sneeze the inspector did, and somehow the fragment escaped.Arthur Penhaligon was an asthmatic child who wasn''t enjoying his first Monday at his new school. This was due to a sadistic teacher who forced him to run a cross-country course, resulting in a near death experience, during which he encountered the unlikely duo of Sneezer and Mister Monday. Suddenly he was the holder of a strange key, shaped like the minute hand of a clock, and Mister Monday was impatiently waiting for Arthur''s expiry date to come up.After these exciting and intriguing introductions, Garth Nix launches into the meaty part of the first book of The Keys to the Kingdom series, where one of the most unlikely of heroes struggles reluctantly to fulfill his destiny, while trying to save his own world from a deadly plague. This story contains a great deal of violence, but fortunately while it is perfectly clear that pain is being inflicted with gleeful enjoyment and wanton abandon by Monday''s associates, the descriptions are not graphic enough to be overly upsetting to the faint of heart.Young adult readers may be slightly confused by all the twists and machinations, but will still be thrilled by the adventures of Arthur and his friend Suzy Turquoise Blue as they negotiate the secrets of the House, guided by the Will, and armed with nothing but the Key, a great deal of common sense, and a very strong will to survive.Amanda Richards');

He doesn''t want to appear stupid on the first day of school, so he decides to run even though he knows it could be really devasting to his health. And lone behold, Arthur has a severe asthma attack. However, just as he is about to die, he is handed a key shaped like a minute hand from a mysterious person called Mr. Monday who definitely doesn''t belong in our world. Arthur survives, but soon his whole world is turned upside down. Mysterious dog faced animals are chasing after Arthur trying to get back the key, and they''ve brought a mysterious Sleeping Plague with them that could kill thousands, if not millions, since the doctors seem to have no cure at all. Soon Arthur realizes, that he, himself will have to venture into "The House", a house that only he can see, to save his world from utter destruction. It is in "The House" that Arthur makes friends with Suzy Turquoise Blue, and learns from "The Will" of his true destiny and has his final showdown with Mr. Monday.I had high expectations for Garth Nix''s new series since I was an absolute fanatic over his Sabriel Trilogy and The Seventh Towers Series. After reading the first chapter of this book, I knew that I wouldn''t be disappointed as it just sucks you in. I found this book to be more darker than Garth Nix''s past stories, but you can definitely tell his unique writing style. His story structure carries over and you can pinpoint many similarties with this book and his other works. Arthur is a great protagonist, though he lacks the charm of Sabriel and Tal from Garth Nix''s previous books.

Arthur quickly learns that Grim Tuesday has found a convenient loophole in the Trustee agreement, and that all Mister Monday''s substantial debts have been passed on to him as the new Master of the Lower House. Grim T. means to collect one way or the other, and as the world''s economy gets turned on its end, Arthur realizes that he has no choice but to go back and sort it all out, and of course get the second key and some added responsibility that he can well do without.Greedy Grim Tuesday runs a huge "nothing" mine using slave labor, and makes all the gadgets and widgets and doodads needed by the Days and anybody with the right currency. Lots of new and deadly creatures await Arthur, some of whom are allergic to salt and some to silver, but all have the common goal of inflicting upon him as much pain as possible. With the help of his friend Leaf (from book one) he finally finds the entrance to Tuesday''s mineshafts, and begins his new quest, going deep, deep undercover as one of Tuesday''s slaves.Fortunately for him, he gets a little help from Suzy Turquoise Blue, Japeth the walking Thesaurus, Captain Shelvocke the sea-faring brother of the Pied Piper, and to a lesser extent a hairy, materialistic bit of fluff formally known as "eyebrow". Soon he''s sailing off into very strange waters to retrieve the second fragment of the Will, with a heavy heart, a broken leg and almost more problems than he can bear.Exciting and imaginative, although sometimes a tad long on description, Nix wraps this one up rather quickly at the end, and gives a tantalizing glimpse into Wednesday''s woes. A must-read if you''ve completed your Monday reading.Amanda Richards');

He has cured the Sleepy Plague by releasing a Nightsweeper and now is ready for some well-deserved rest. What else could he be needed for? Plenty, it seems, when the Will calls upon Arthur''s assistance early Tuesday morning.Arthur is told that Grim Tuesday has found a loophole in the Agreement and has laid claim to the Lower House and the First Key as payment for debts owed by Mister Monday over the last thousand years. The Will tells Arthur that he must come to the House and stop Grim Tuesday before he takes over Arthur''s newly acquired position and the world. Arthur is furious at having to enter the realms of the House again so soon and is baffled when the connection to the red old-fashioned telephone the Will gave him is cut off because his credit is being revoked by the Court of the Days. He then observes two Grotesques of Grim Tuesday putting up a magical SOLD sign outside his family''s home. Arthur learns that he must get to the House by noon before his life in the Secondary Realm is ruined.Arthur discovers that getting into the House will not be easy this time around. While looking for a visible entrance, he notices some sort of Nithling lurking in a garden across the street. Arthur is wary of the thing and decides to look it up in the Atlas. He reads that the strange creature is not just any Nithling but a Scoucher that soon chases Arthur and tries to attack him with its deadly tentacles. Arthur hears his friend Leaf call his name and hides in her house when she notices the Scoucher following him.The two friends hide in the garage while they try to find some silver to vanquish the creature. They are able to defeat the Scoucher with a medal but not before Leaf is seriously injured. As Arthur applies first-aid, Leaf tells him how to get into the House through a dream she has. Arthur is worried about Leaf''s condition but she convinces him to leave, knowing that help is on the way. With only minutes to spare, Arthur heads over to the old mill that Leaf described.Once inside the mill, Arthur sees that a Grotesque is up to no good and has to fight him in order to get inside the House. He manages to do so and notices that much has changed since the last time he was there. The Lieutenant Keeper of the Front Door helps prevent the boy from having an asthma attack and tells him that he must go to The Far Reaches in order to reach Grim Tuesday''s domain. Arthur doesn''t want to go, but the Lieutenant is persistent and helps disguise the boy as an indentured Denizen. All indentured Denizens work in the terrifying place called the Pit.On the journey towards the Pit, Arthur meets a Denizen named Japeth, who tells him about the life of indentured Denizens and the system they work in. Arthur becomes anxious at the thought of having to work alongside Grim Tuesday''s train as an indentured servant. He grows tired and Japeth stays behind to help him as the rest of their group continues traveling to the Pit. Arthur''s friend Suzy Turquoise Blue shows up along the railway in a stolen wheel contraption. Suzy informs her friend that they have to use ascension wings to get out of the pit and climb across the ceiling of the Far Reaches in order to get to the spire of Grim Tuesday''s Treasure Tower and find Part Two of the Will.Suzy and Arthur arrive at the Tower but not without some frightening encounters involving Nothing and a meeting with one of Grim Tuesday''s eyebrows named Soot, who only wants to get to Tuesday''s treasure. The friends are wary of him, but with Soot''s assistance they get into the Tower. Suzy and Arthur continue their search with the help of a strange mariner named Captain Tom Shelvocke, who claims to be one of the sons of the Architect and the Old One. The trio then travel to the Sun to retrieve Part Two of the Will on an island by way of a magical spaceship.However, there are many dangers that still await them. Will the second part of the Will be retrieved and can Grim Tuesday be stopped? What is the hideous surprise that lurks in the shadows of Nothing? Will Arthur ever make it home in time to save his family? These and many other questions are raised in this entertaining and intriguing novel, Garth Nix''s second installment in his Keys to the Kingdom series.  --- (...)');

People are killed, new creatures appear, and Arthur finds himself in a lethal power struggle with the Morrow Days. Garth Nix is in fine form in this book, one of the best of the series, and it only promises to get better.When Arthur and Leaf try to return to Earth, they are stopped by Dame Primus -- it seems that a Spirit-Eater (the Skinless Boy) has taken Arthur''s place on Earth. If he goes back home, he might destroy the world. To make matters worse, he is tricked into accepting Sir Thursday''s shilling, which means he''s been drafted into the army... for a hundred years.Leaf goes back to Earth, and tries to destroy the Skinless Boy, with the unexpected help of Suzy. Meanwhile, Arthur struggles in the Army -- especially since part of it is being "washed between the ears." As he tries to remember to remember who he is, Arthur becomes a part of the regiment fighting a new breed of Nithling -- and under the command of the berserk Sir Thursday.Unexpected twists are the order of the day on "Thursday" -- Garth Nix serves up mind-reading spores, assassinations, new Nithlings, and the Piper (often mentioned, but never before seen). With a stunning ending and some otherworldly battles, this is probably the best book since "Mister Monday."And Nix''s detailed, dark-edged writing is given a full workout here.He does a great job of describing battles against Nithlings and Nothing, as well as the creepy invasion into our own world. It takes awhile for Sir Thursday to even become part of the plot -- much of the book, actually -- but when he does show up, he''s a suitably nasty Day. Think a demented drill sargeant.Since Arthur has already come to terms with being the Heir, Nix lets him focus on something even scarier -- using the Keys is slowly turning him into a Denizen. Since he has amnesia for a good chunk of the book, he''s most afraid near the end. And Leaf gets some further fleshing-out, as she tries to destroy the Skinless Boy without being taken over by it.Perhaps the worst part of it is that "Sir Thursday" ends on a double cliffhanger. It''s going to be awhile before we''re introduced to Lady Friday, but "Sir Thursday" was worth the wait. Chilling and wonderfully dark.');

Starting at the bottom, Arthur changes his name to Ray, and undergoes basic training in weaponry and warfare before being led off to battle.There are actually two stories going on simultaneously in this book. In one of them, Arthur has been replaced in the real world by a doppelganger, which has used a personal item of Arthur''s to spawn the perfect image. Having infiltrated, the Arthur-copy is running around infecting people with a gray mould, which allows it to read their minds gathering information to complete the take-over. Arthur is much too busy to deal with this matter, so his friend Leaf steps up to the plate and goes on a clone-hunt.Back to Arthur, he''s a pawn on a chessboard-like battlefield, with one significant difference - the squares move around at dusk. (Pity the unfortunate soul who''s stuck half-way on the boundary of two squares when this happens.) The enemy is a horde of souped-up nithlings who''ve undergone extreme make-overs to become battalions of uber-nithlings, led by a mysterious yet familiar figure.There''s fighting and bloodshed and lots of other good stuff in this one, which should make an excellent adventure movie.

Additionally, he is now trapped in the House since a Nithling has taken over his life back on Earth and is taking over the minds of his family and friends.The story follows Arthur as he goes undercover in the army, as well as Leaf who is charged with defeating the Nithling on Earth which has now become both a war and a biohazard zone.While a little bogged down with the imaginative description of the details associated with the various military costumes and ranks, Garth Nix''s creativity continues to deliver page-turning excitement. I could barely put down the book. Even more so than in the previous books, there were many accessory characters who come in and out of the plot, and while most of them are forgettable (except for Sylvie, a spunky old lady), it doesn''t matter that we don''t know much about them because the central characters are so compelling. Arthur has grown and matured incredibly since his adventures started and Leaf, who is given a central role, takes her place beside Suzy as one of the main players. The Will, when it finally appears, is as unique as ever (although nothing quite matches the Carp from book three), and the ending yields several surprises and the requisite cliffhanger.It''s a fitting middle book in a presumably seven book series, and successfully gears us up for the adventures to come. It''s clear that Arthur''s toughest battles are yet to come. Can''t wait!');

I wasn''tdisappointed. The action moves along quickly, with new and original presentations of magic at every turn, and major and minor characters worth cheering for (or, in the case of the antagonists, against).The sixth book in Nix''s KEYS TO THE KINGDOM series picks up right where the fifth book left off, making it a little confusing to understand at first, especially if you''re a newcomer to the series, like I was when reading this. The book is certainly good enough to merit your going to the library and checking out all of the previous ones in order to get up to speed, but in case your library is as negligent as mine, here''s the background that I wish I could have had going in.Our protagonist, asthmatic twelve-year-old Arthur Penhaligon, through a series of complicated circumstances described in previous novels, is taken from his home on Earth and granted the power of being the Heir to the Kingdom. Nix''s complicated but fascinating universe centers around a grand House that is the epicenter of all universes, and is ruled by seven Trustees, all named for the days of the week. Within the House, each Trustee has its own domain. As the Heir, Arthur''s duty is to wrest the Keys to the Kingdom from the corrupt Trustees, and to recreate the Will of the Architect, which the Trustees have consistently disobeyed. The Architect is a mysterious figure responsible for creating both the House and the "secondary realms," including Earth.In this sixth book in the series, Arthur is up against one of the toughest of the Trustees: Superior Saturday, with her power to work great sorceries with the help of the sixth Key. With the help of friends and acquaintances throughout the House, Arthur attempts to infiltrate Saturday''s portion of the House and find the sixth part of the Architect''s Will. He''s running out of time, though, as the dangerously corrosive Nothing eats away at the House''s foundations.Arthur must retrieve the Key, and the next part of the Will, in time to ensure that the House is not destroyed--for if the epicenter of all universes is demolished, the secondary realms that depend upon its survival will also crumble and fall, making for the end of Earth and Arthur''s home.Nix always has a unique perspective on magic, and this series is no different in that respect. His innovations draw heavily upon archetypes and numerous different branches of mythology that add a richness and texture to his world, even if the average reader does not see them all on the first read-through. I also enjoyed his characterization of Arthur, a young boy who is taking on increasingly difficult tasks and succeeding at them, so that although he is young, there is a strength and maturity to his outlook. Of course, this doesn''t prevent him from having his share of doubts.Overall, I highly enjoyed this book and would recommend the series to anyone interested in fantasy adventure.Reviewed by: Candace Cunard');

Not for him, and not for the House.In fact, just about everything is tumbling down in the penultimate book of Garth Nix''s Keys to the Kingdom series, "Superior Saturday," in which Arthur finally encounters the malevolent sorceress who''s been messing things up throughout the series. It''s a suitably chaotic and haunting story, and Arthur''s internal struggles and new discoveries are a pretty fascinating read -- but don''t expect it to really end on anything but a massive cliffhanger.Arthur receives an emergency call from his brother, who warns him that the Army is about to nuke their entire town. Desperate, Arthur tries to shield the town, but instead ends up slowing time. Unfortunately that is only one of his worries: the magic of the Keys is transforming Arthur''s body and mind into something inhuman, and Nothing is eroding away the very foundations of the House. To stop it, he must somehow steal away Superior Saturday''s power, and he has to rely on one of the less reliable forces in the House to smuggle himself and Suzy into Saturday''s domain.While Leaf and her pal struggle to save Friday''s sleeping victims, Arthur explores Saturday''s realm. Turns out Saturday is building a vast tower built by Piper''s Children and overseen by sorcerers, so she can reach the Incomparable Gardens that Lord Sunday rules -- and what''s more, Arthur is having a lot of trouble locating the Will. His only hope is to climb the tower with Saturday''s sorcerous army -- but what awaits them at the top?"Superior Saturday" is not just saturated in rain, but in desperation. A lot of bad things are happening all at once, since the House is about to collapse, the town is about to be bombed by the Army, all the Piper''s rats and children are suspect, and Arthur has found that he can''t even trust Dame Primus anymore. There are a lot of bad things going on in "Superior Saturday," but Nix also unfolds some intriguing new revelations about the House and its purpose, during another visit to the imprisoned Old One.And Nix somehow loads all of this into the plot without making it feel clunky or infodumpy. He spins a suitably dark and gloomy atmosphere over Saturday''s domain, full of steampunk-style machinary and lots of ever-drizzling rain. It moves pretty gradually for awhile, but speeds up after Arthur locates the Will, and bumps into another old enemy. And Nix isn''t afraid to throw in some horror moments, such as an unfortunate Denizen whose body was dissolved by Nothing, or the chaotic attacks on Saturday''s army during the climax.The biggest problem is that "Superior Saturday" doesn''t really end -- the action and tension slowly build for a long time, only to snap like a recoiling spring... on a cliffhanger. Rather than being story unto itself, it''s the first half of a story that "Lord Sunday" will finish.While Arthur seems to accept his transformation a bit too easily, his struggles with his inhuman thoughts ("For a moment he even felt like striking Scamandros, or forcing the Denizen to prostrate himself and beg forgiveness") and rapidly changing body are well-drawn. And Nix raises some intriguing questions about just what it is that Arthur is turning into, since it''s made quite clear that he''s not transforming into a run-of-the-mill Denizen.While it has no real ending, "Superior Saturday" is a dark, mildly horrific ride through what is left of the House, and promises a spellbinding finale in the final Keys to the Kingdom novel. An enthralling little book, so long as you don''t mind waiting for what comes next.');

As if moving and being asthmatic wasn''t bad enough, now he has had two nightmarish adventures, and dealt with the malevolent Morrow Days. In the third book of Garth Nix''s dark fantasy series, "Drowned Wednesday," Nix spins his best story yet in this series.Arthur and his pal Leaf are recuperating from the strange events of Monday and Tuesday... until suddenly the hospital is flooded. Leaf is abducted by a strange boat, and Arthur finds himself adrift on the Border Sea, on a hospital bed. After he''s picked up by a shipful of friendly Salvagers, he finds that he''s inadvertantly become the target for the malevolent pirate Feverfew, a mortal-turned-Denizen on a ship of bone.He also encounters Drowned Wednesday, who has invited him to lunch. But unlike Grim Tuesday and Mister Monday, Wednesday needs his help, because she is cursed: she takes the form of a whale, and has a monstrous appetite. She''s willing to give him the Key, but he has to deal with the malevolent Feverfew first, and rescue Leaf. Unfortunately to do that, he will have to take a rescue submarine to a seaport... which happens to be inside Wednesday''s stomach.For some reason, after the publication of "Grim Tuesday," the publishers decided to halt production and rerelease the two previous books in hardcover. As a result, "Drowned Wednesday" took forever to come out. Fortunately, it was worth the wait: as writing and characters go, "Drowned Wednesday" beats the second book and equals the first."Drowned Wednesday" more or less fits the mold of the previous novels: Arthur deals with the strange residents (rats and Denizens) of the various worlds, while trying to avoid being killed. It sounds grim, but Nix spices it up with plenty of humor, such as the stamp-collecting Salvager captain. One of the funniest moments has Arthur looking at a book about his adventures, which shows him as a buff action hero.Fortunately, Nix keeps the story from getting formulaic by giving new twists to the story. Not only is it a seafaring tale, but he portrays the Morrow Day Wednesday as a victim, not a villain. Though Arthur is initially suspicious, it turns out that she''s actually rather pitiful. And the final chapter of the book ends on an eerie cliffhanger involving the Skinless Boy.The biggest change is in Arthur himself. In the previous two books, he was a reluctant hero. But now he is beginning to use the power of the Keys without worrying about it, and he is determined to deal with the other Morrow Days. Okay, he still worries a lot, but he''s overcoming that; by the finale, he is much more comfortable as the Heir."Drowned Wednesday" equals "Mister Monday" for humorous dark-fantasy goodness.

A ship is dispatched to pick him up, which is an unusual mode of transport seeing that he is in a hospital far away from any major body of water. Arrangements are made to resolve this minor inconvenience, and soon Arthur is adrift on his steel bed accompanied by his friend Leaf who was visiting at the time.Unfortunately the crew of the Flying Mantis picks up the wrong passenger, and Arthur is left adrift, broken leg and all, and with sinking bed and spirits. His spirits are "buoyed" in the nick of time when he discovers a convenient flotation device, but this turns out to be a not a blessing in disguise, but a disaster in the making.Caught red-handed fooling around with pirate treasure, he is picked up by the crew of a ship named the Moth, and barely escapes being captured by the dread pirate Feverfew (owner of said treasure) and his ship of bone, the Shiver. Soon it''s time for lunch with Lady Wednesday, who is cursed with the sin of gluttony, and has been transformed into a creature worthy of her voracious appetite. Barely escaping being a part of the menu, Arthur agrees to an alliance for ownership of the third key and sets off on his third quest of the week in the name of the Will. This proves to be a huge pill to swallow, and gives him a sinking feeling in the pit of his stomach.The most exciting adventure of the series so far, this one is heavily laden with sea-faring rats with both two and four legs, sorcery and heroic deeds, and the humor is at its very best.

"Lord Sunday" is a little rushed and scattered at times, but Nix ties off the various plot threads in a satisfying manner -- and he demonstrates his brilliant skill by handling the seemingly impossible.Now transformed into a Denizen, Arthur struggles his way back to the Incomparable Gardens -- only to be captured by the cruel, selfish Lord Sunday and his minions. Meanwhile, Leaf is captured by Sunday''s Reaper and dragged back into the House, and Suzy is struggling to keep the army from being destroyed by the Nothing, Newniths and the Piper''s Children.Unsurprisingly, Lord Sunday wants the Atlas and the Keys. Arthur will have to use all his wits and sorcerous strength -- as well as an old, beloved friend -- to free himself from Sunday''s clocklike torture chamber. As the final clash between Sunday, Saturday and the Piper begins, Arthur''s true destiny is revealed -- and it may mean the destruction of all the worlds of the House."Lord Sunday" has almost everything you could want in a grand, apocalyptic finale -- magic, battles, tragic losses, and finally the revelation of the Architect''s true Will. It took six books of complex build-ups to get to this point, and for most of the book Nix focuses on the main characters zipping around trying to save the House from destruction.But the story becomes truly brilliant in the last few chapters. Nix''s prose becomes exquisitely simple and evocative, even as he weaves some philosophical moments that reveal why the Architect did all the things that set the story in motion -- and why Arthur was necessary for her Will. In many ways, it''s a bittersweet finale for Nix''s series, but it also leaves you feeling satisfied and hopeful.Problems? The titular Lord Sunday isn''t much of a character (he''s more of a one-off obstacle), and a really tragic loss for Arthur is handled almost as an afterthought.Fortunately, Arthur''s own fate is handled with great care. While Leaf, Suzy and a few other characters (including the adorable Elephant and the beastwort Daisy) get moments to shine, "Lord Sunday" is about taking Arthur to the end of his journey, and handling the divide between his Denizen body and his human heart. Without revealing too much, Nix handles it in a logical, fantastical way that simply makes perfect sense."Lord Sunday" has a few flaws here and there, but it is a truly brilliant, powerful wrap-up for Garth Nix''s epic fantasy series.

I appreciated this atypical viewpoint, because I think it''s hard to pull off; a protagonist like Clariel is inherently more difficult for a reader to warm to, as compared to a protagonist like Sabriel and Lirael, and her actions and the events that occur around her are subsequently less likely to satisfy a reader''s taste for heroism.

So I also appreciated the plot structure; again, like Clariel''s personality, it wasn''t predictable given the YA genre of the book. The thing I liked least about the book was the portrayal of Clariel''s relationship with Bel; I didn''t find the development of Bel''s feelings for Clariel believable. (But I tend to be picky about the portrayal of romance in books in general, so this may not bother another reader.)');

Clariel is a great character, an evil one in the future books, but this goes back to tell her beginning story and I fell in love with her. A victim of her circumstances who did the best she could while unknowingly being lead astray. The book ends way before she is introduced in the series in "Lirael", so Nix has left himself open to write further adventures for that time period. I like to read books in the order they are written not chronologically by time period but this does work well to read it first.

A few things that bothered me about the last books, and what improves in Eulalia:1) Jacques seemed to have given up having a funny, "main" hare in his books. Earlier ones include Basil, Boorab, Clecky, Scarum, Tarquin, Dotti, and many more. In these last few books, he started to resort to groups of the Long Patrol, who stayed in the background and never had a big part. Now the old theme is back, with Maudie more than filling the place. So that is exitement number one :D2) Readers may have noticed in the last few books that rather "cheesy" plots were taking the place of the older, simpler ones. (I mean, contrast this: A big, savage wolverine on a quest to recover a precious turtle; And a worried father at Redwall setting out on a quest to find his daughter. Big difference!) Now there is another simple plot in the old style, with a haremaid sent to find a badger lord. I enjoy that a LOT more.3) The names seem to be getting back to normal ;D Maudie and Rangval are much preferable to Brooky and Doogy Plumm, in my opinion.I gave this book four stars because a few things did bother me about it. One of them is that I don''t like that the books are now being written in chronological order. When you know that a new Redwall book is about all new characters, it''s not as exiting than if Jacques was still moving around in time. I mean, how exiting it would be if he went back and wrote a book set when Salamandastron was young, and still a volcano! Or set in the time when Mattimeo was Warrior of Redwall. Or maybe about Taggerung''s son. Or something like that. And though I like the Maudies and Meheras almost as much as the Cornflowers and Columbines, they can never quite replace them. And since the books are no longer moving about in time, it dosn''t look like they''ll be coming back. *sigh* I''ll just have to go get Redwall and Mossflower off my shelf and read them again :D The other thing is that this book is a bit slow at the beginning.

As in the fifteen books preceding, LOAMHEDGE is full of mystery, adventure, romance, tragedy, and a myriad of characters we care about. In this book we are introduced to the wheelchair-bound hare named Martha Braebuck. More than anything, Martha would love to walk again, and this possibility comes to her through a vision/dream in which Martin the Warrior gives her some hints concerning the old abbey. If she can uncover these secrets, Martha should be able to lead a normal life.When she shares her vision with other folks at the Abbey, they all work together to turn this miracle into a reality. This "quest" is helped along by the zany and loving characters of Braggon the otter and Sarobando the squirrel, best friends and former pranksters of the abbey who have been on their own world adventures and are ready and willing for yet another.As always there are many layers to these stories, as interesting little characters weave in and out, creating subplots and more adventures. They include Martha''s mischievous brother Horty --- who runs off with Sarobando and Braggon to help his sister, the evil searat Raga Bol (who holds the abbey under siege) --- and of course, all the fun "Redwallers" who are part of the colorful tapestry of the Redwall series.Jacques''s ability to create these wonderful personalities, evil and good, from animals is the height of skilled anthropomorphic writing. He has a huge following with a web site that is visited by many fans around the world ([...] Outstanding artists lend these books an even greater depth --- all the covers are beautifully done, including this one with Troy Howell''s beautiful painting. Charming ink drawings by David Elliot introduce each chapter and are also often featured on the web site.Even if you have never read any books in this series before, you will still enjoy this latest addition to Redwall.  --- Reviewed by Sally M.

Yes,it is same old same old, and yes the villans are always the same,but isn''t that the point of Redwall? I personally get satisfaction from reading familiar-ish stories that are related.E.g at the end of ''The Taggerung'' where Russano turns up with the long patrol,it isn''t a surprise and that sort of ''last-ditch help'' has happened before,but its an excellent moment nonetheless.I own all of the Redwall books and am an avid reader,but I don''t take the books as a serious novel,more an enjoyable yarn.The points though are fairly true.The formula is starting to tire, and ''Triss'' was a pretty poor book.Anyway,Loamhedge is a good read.It is enjoyable throughout,and Jaques'' ability to whet the (fans) appetite with infomation on the history of the world of Mossflower is good here,especially with the nostalgic nods toward Mattemio (though my lips are sealed).The characters are good,but not as good as previous characters,as Jaques doesn''t explore the charaters fully,leaving them as a seeming supporting character.The main characters therefore are probably Horty and Martha. Problems arise here,as the characters seem very distant. Another problem is that the book is overly predictable and there is no huge battle ,instead there are smaller ones,that seem rushed.Also Jaques at times seems to get carried away,and as in previous books writes something out of turn with the world he has created.When Martha just gets up and walks,the point of the book becomes irrelevant.Moments like this have hampered an otherwise great series through all the books,where his ''animals are medieval humans'' idea becomes unrealistic and off balence with the major idea.Still,problems aside this is a good book,so read it,and you will enjoy it,but Jaques needs to prodoce something aweome from his next book to keep his fanbase,as they have started to drift away since ''The Legend of Luke''.');

In Triss, for the first time we get to see a female warrior of Redwall and a talented one at that.Triss tells 3 stories that eventually weave into each other. Far to the North live three slaves, Triss, Welfro and Shogg, who somehow escape from the clutches of the cruel King Aragnu and his daughter the evil Princess Kudra. As they travel away in a stolen ship they realize that eventually they will have to return home to save their friends, but not until they have saved themselves. To the South in Salamandastron Sagax, a young badger Lord sets out to sea with his two close friends the gluttonous hare Scarum and the clever otter Kroova, in search of adventure. They end up getting much more than they bargained for. And to the East in the legendary Redwall Abbey, both the young and the old struggle to solve some tricky riddles that may hold the key to the location of the old and forgotten Brockhall.Just like the past 14 Redwall books Triss is filled with adventure, humor, action, and mystery. But Triss is no ordinary Redwall book. Since it takes place generations after Taggerung we have a whole new cast of interesting charecters to learn about. my favorites are Kroova the otter and the warriormaid Triss herself. The Humor in Triss is far the best we''ve ever seen in any Redwall book. Don''t believe me? Well, wait until you read the section about Pluggs'' tail! That made me giggle. People who criticized Taggerung for uninteresting riddles will be pleasantly surprise in Brian Jacques puzzling new inventions that take a bit of thought.A do have a couple criticisms though. One is the abundance of songs. I realize that they''re important to Scarum''s character but enough already! It seems like Mr. Jacques sticks in songs jsut to take up space at times. Another one is I would have liked to see Mr. Jacques go into more detail about a couple events. One being the meeting and greeting of Triss''s group to Sagax''s groups, the other being about Triss seeing the sword of Martin for the first time. Still despite these faults Brian Jacques delivers one of the greatest books in the series. Triss joins the rank of Mariel and Songbreeze Swifteye as one of the most likable heroines ever seen in this series. Scarum is a great character too.I could go on for hours just talking about this book it was that good but I''ll spare you my blabbering and let you decide for yourself. Fans of Redwall rejoice.

In a word, Redwall has lost its novelty and sparkle, and the author would best abandon it for his other projects, including Castaways of the Flying Dutchman.I bought Triss because (unlike many of the recent Redwall books) the plot actually sounded interesting. Unfortunately, though Jacques can still set a story quite well, he can no longer take advantage of his own plots. The book was highly predictable, to offset which Jacques filled it with reversals of fate and twists and turns that did not really alleviate its predictability. Similarly, the characters are merely caricatures of Jacques'' more memorable creations, and the settings are no longer settings but set-pieces. For instance, Brockhall plays a role in this book, but in an entirely boring way. Also, Jacques now feels compelled to insert a song in virtually every chapter, as well as to repeat descriptions of food verbatim. He also uses the same jokes over and over. That said, there were some genuine laugh-out-loud moments, and I was glad to see that female characters are now evenly placed among warriors and villains, instead of just abbey-dwellers.I was at one point a diehard Redwall fan, and the first seven books in the series are still some of the best books I own. However, the fire has gone out of Jacques'' writing; I do not think any of his Redwall books will ever stir me as much as Mossflower, Salamandastron, or my other favorites did and still do. So save seven bucks and go reread them, or better yet, something else.

The King, being a just, yet aging wildcat, saw more in Martin than the others. The King decided it wouldn''t be wise to kill him, but the King''s daughter, Tsarmina, a cold-hearted wretch, thought he deservd to be killed immediately. Tsarmina broke Martin''s sword in her rage,a big mistake, for then Martin vowed he would slay her one day. Tsarmina poisoned her own father and then blamed it on her gentle, younger brother, Gingivere. She declared herself ruler of Kotir. She had Martin and Gingivere thrown into the dungeon. In the dungeon Martin met his cell mate, a prince of thieves by the name of Gonff. Gonff was a very comical character indeed ( he was my favorite) he always chanted verses of poems, even in the worst of times. Gonff and Martin became fast friends and decided to be mates. They both escaped out of the dungeon and went back to Mossflower. Bella of Brockall, knew as soon as she met Martin that he was a worthy one and sent him, Gonff and Dinny (the mole) on a mission to find Boar the Fighter who is also her father, in Salmandastron,( a land where no one has ever returned from) and tell him to come back to Mossflower for the mishap with Queen Tsarmina. As well as hearing Martin''s quest, you also hear how the rest of the woodlanders dealt with Tsarmina''s forces. Even though, Tsarmina''s force''s said woodlanders were dumb, the woodlanders would always outwit her forces somehow. In the beginning you really have to pay attention otherwise you''ll put it down and miss out on it!');

No child shall live past its fourteenth birthday. On that Sad Birthday, the child is taken to the "Meat Factory" to be dismantled and harvested. The harvests result in the creation and construction of machine like beings whose only purpose is to kill.The only hope for the rest of the human race is Shade and his legion of children. His children have been saved from the Overlords and given refuge on his large submarine that rests at the edge of the fallen cities. Only, Shade is not a man. He is not a computer either. More, he is a mixture of both. After the Change, the horrible time when the Overlords came and took over Earth, Shade found himself changed into something that was more than a man, more than a machine.Others were changed too. Each child that was alive during the Change developed a Change Talent. Among them are Ella, Drum, Gold-Eye and Ninde. Ella is able to make anything she thinks about appear. Drum can bloat himself to ten times his shape. Gold-Eye can see the near future and Ninde can read the minds of the creatures around her.They will need all their talents and their skills to win back their planet. Shade sends them on dangerous missions to find valuable information that he can use against the enemy. The information may cost them their lives. When Drum is taken to the Meat Factory, they all go after him. When it seems that someone in their group has betrayed them, things become a lot more dangerous than any of Shade''s Children had bargained for.I have never read a science fiction book from cover to cover. Perhaps it was the scientific element that threw me off (I was never very good at science) but I was never interested in science fiction. It never appealed to me. I was never able to wrap my brain around a plot that involved technology and futuristic elements. It just wasn''t my thing. That has all changed.From the first page of "Shade''s Children," I was hooked. I couldn''t put the book down and I gulped it back in four days.Though the book is written for a young adult audience, it is still dark and gritty enough to please anyone. The story is tense, suspenseful and full of twists and turns. Though at times the plot is a bit thin, it is still an amazing read.The book is full of humor and wit and there is even a bit of nudity and sensuality thrown into the mix.

I also liked this book because, though it involves animals, there was a type of "romance" in it, which was rather underplayed in his other books. 2 young hares have a bit of affection for eachother, and Jacques actually builds that up a bit, instead of the few other books of his ive read that have a male and female couple who are supposed to "be in love" where they just say hi and then get married and what not. But anyways, the book was pretty cool, though i didnt really like the female badger lord, cause she was too overbearing and not really what badger lords are normally like. The skirmishes and major battles were extremely cool, though short. I was a bit disappointed with how this book ended, though... Tammo didn''t go back to his parents, it seemed Jacques ignored the fact that Tamm''s mom had told the whole story about his father running off and never being reconciled with his father. Since he put that part in there Tammo should''ve had something happen with him and his father.  But other than that it was a quality Redwall book.');

Young kids have trouble comprehending the older kid/adult-directed words, and the story is great. Believe me. Try a book from this series, no matter who you are.

Everyone on board are either killed or taken to Gabool''s fortress Bladegirt on the isle of Terramort to be made as oarslaves. Joseph is kept alive to be made to tell what the symbols on the great bell mean, but he remains silent. Mariel though is thrown off the cliffs of Terramort for attacking Gabool and making a fool of him before his followers.She is carried by the tide towards the coast near the swamp lands. She remembers nothing so she calls herself Storm Gullwhacker, Storm because she remembers the terrible storm she was in and Gullwhacker, because of a rope she found which is knotted and used as a weapon. She meets three hares from the Long Patrol, Colonel Clary Meadowcleary, Brigadier Thyme, and Honorable Rosemary (called Hon Rosie). They take her to an odd old squirrel named Pakatugg who will lead her to safety, to Redwall. Instead, Storm (Mariel)gets so frustrated with him that she leaves him. Fortunately, he meets up with Tarquin L. Woodsorrel, a hare from the Long Patrol who was sent by Lord Rawnblade to stay at Redwall (he is also very much in love with Hon Rosie!) He takes her to Redwall Abbey.There Storm (Mariel) makes friends with two mice, Dandin and Saxtus. Mariel regains her memory though when Saxtus recites an old prophecy which includes her father and her. She is determined to go to Terramort to free her father and to kill Gabool. The only clues to the direction of Terramort is an old poem and she sets out with her friends Dandin, Tarquin, and Durry Quill, a friendly porcupine. But before they had left, in a dream, Dandin was visited by the legendary Martin the Warrior and when he woke up, Martin''s sword was next to him. The group knows that the spirit of Martin is with them.But they are not the only ones who are heading towards danger. One of Gabool''s captains has deserted with his crew. Their plans, to take over Redwall...This is a really fun book, exciting with plenty of action and suspense. My favorite characters in this book are probably all the hares, Dandin, and Durry Quill. I love the way the hares talk, in a very British way. For example, "Y''don''t suppose they''ve bally well gone to bed, wot?" "Hardly, old chap." And so on.The next book to read after this is definitely "The Bellmaker", with almost all the same main characters as this book. But I strongly suggest you read as many Redwall books as you can because they''re ALL great!!');

On their way, they are attacked by a crew of evil searats, under the command of Gabool the Wild, who is the King of all Searats and a rather insane and a very evil and cruel searat. All of the ship''s crew is killed or is kept alive for oarslaves. The oarslaves who are alive are taken to Gabool''s fortress called Teramorrt. Joseph is kept alive to build a belltower for Gabool. Mariel is thrown into the sea from Teramorrt because she had almost killed Gabool infront of his searats.Mariel survives the storm and is washed ashore on a swamp island. She had lost her memory so she calls herself Storm Gullwacker because she had been carried by the tide during a storm and because of a rope that is knotted at the end and she used it as a weapon to ward of hungry seagulls.

Mariel starts finding the Abbey alone but is hopelessly lost in the large woods of Mossflower. She luckily meets a singer hare called Tarquin and he takes her to Redwall.

Swartt goes to the south to meet the fat warlord, Bowel. There, Swartt cleverly poisons Bowel, taking over the horde of the true Warlord. Swartt goes,then, to kill Sunflash.Meanwhile, Sunflash had made lots of friends by doing justice to those who were tormented by bigger animals. His fame spread across the land as animals were freed from the evil vermin. Skarlath scouted the land, telling Sunglash of Swartt''s moves. Sunflash goes to Salamandastron to claim his rightful identity: he was the son of Boar the Fighter and Bella of Brockhall.Swartt''s wife gives birth to a son but dies doing so. Swartt, showing no emotions for his dead wife , gives the son to an old nursemaid. During a battle with the inhabitants of Redwall, he leaves the son on the ground, leaving him for dead. The kind animals of Redwall takes him in, naming him Veil. Veil grows up to become bad and is cast out after he had committed an unforgivable crime: trying to poison the Friar.Sunflash had returned to his home. He launches many attacks on Swartt''s horde and wins again and again,but does not make any huge dent on the six-clawed ferret''s enormous horde of vermins.And the battle goes on as Swartt nearly kills Sunflash.What would happen to Sunflash and Swartt? Would Veil chose to join his father''s side to kill the people of Redwall and Salamandastron? Read this book to find out, though I must warn you that you just MIGHT be dissappointed.The reason I put 4 stars was because the title did not match the book''s story at all!

This book was the first Redwall book I read, and this book made me want to read the others. It does a close look at the roots of good and evil, represented physically by Veil Sixclaw and Sunflash the Mace. Looking at Sunflash, Brian Jacques shows good as trying to eliminate evil for the preservation of good, but he also goes farther than that. He also shows good as kindness to those one meets, and a willingness to live life in a simple way, taking joy in things that are "real" accomplishments, like growing and harvesting your own food, or passing out jobs to those who are the most skilled and just in that field. Brian Jacques shows evil in Veil Sixclaw as starting young, possibly existing at birth because of the evil of a parent or both parents. But, once again, Brian Jacques goes deeper than that, showing that evil is also acting selfishly, doing things just for yourself, or just for the sake of cruelty. Veil is cast out of Redwall for attempted murder, and his faithful caretaker, Bryony, always willing to see good in her surroundings, goes after him, trying to bring him to good. Veil hooks up with his father, Swarrt Sixclaw, who is the source of evil Sunflash is determined to destroy. Even when surrounded by evil, though, Veil proves that a little good might just exist in those thought to be evil. This book is great for fantasy lovers, but also for those who wish to look at a rather different view of good and evil.');

In the future, enigmatic beings known as The Overlords have made all humans over age 14 vanish from the planet. All the remaining children were rounded up and placed in "Meat Factories" where they are bred to be used as raw material for slave-construct creatures, like Wingers, Trackers, and the fearsome Myrmidons. The Overlords use these creatures to play out cruel battle games for their own amusement.But a resistance exists: children who have escaped from the dorms and who possess powers that the change in the world has given them. These children work for a being called Shade, a human mind inside a computer. Shade claims to be working at overthrowing the Overlords, but he seems too willing to toss away the lives of the children who serve him. Our four main characters, Drum, Ella, Ninde, and Gold-Eye, come to suspect that Shade has a larger agenda than he says, even as the struggle to defeat the Overlords starts to advance in their favor.Although not as incredible a book as "Sabriel" (one of the best fantasies, adult or young adult, of the last decade), "Shade''s Children" is action-packed, deeply imaginative, and filled with wonderful characters. The book is structured so that between the chapters dealing with the main action are short chapters containing computer read-outs, statistics, interview excerpts, computer self-analysis, etc. This is a clever device that splits up the action and gives dramatic tension to the rest of the book.The four young heroes are realistic and wonderfully written. Ella, the eldest, and a strong leader who feels the great weight of responsibility. Drum, powerful but sterilized from his time in the dorms. Ninde, a teen-girl at heart with simple loves. Gold-Eye, the newest addition, stunted in language but not in bravery or dedication. In many ways, this novel is his story, his journey of self-discovery. Lastly, there is Shade himself -- and there is much more to him than anyone knows or can even guess.Older teens and junior high school students who appreciate a mature kind of science fiction that won''t insult their intelligence will love "Shade''s Children." But I also recommend it to adult science-fiction readers; Nix is a tremendous talent, and he won''t disappoint your cravings for action, characterization, and ingenious world-building.');
